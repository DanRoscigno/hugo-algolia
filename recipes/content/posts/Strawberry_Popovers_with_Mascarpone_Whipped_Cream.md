`Breads` `Summer` `Italian Inspired` `Want to make` `Breakfasts` `Special Meal`

Makes 12 popovers.

**Ingredients:**

_Strawberry Popovers:_

1 1/2 cups (12 fl. oz./375 ml) whole milk

4 eggs

1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 oz./235 g) all-purpose flour

3 Tbs. granulated sugar

3/4 tsp. kosher salt

2 tsp. grated lemon zest

2 tsp. vanilla bean paste

3 Tbs. unsalted butter, melted

8 strawberries, hulled and very thinly sliced

Confectioners’ sugar for dusting

_Mascarpone whipped cream (optional):_

1 cup (8 fl. oz./250 ml) heavy cream

1/2 cup (4 oz./125 g) mascarpone cheese

3 Tbs. granulated sugar

1 tsp. vanilla extract

## **Directions**

Place a standard 12-well muffin pan in an oven and preheat to 425°F (220°C).

In a blender, combine the milk and eggs and blend on high speed until frothy, about 30 seconds. Add the flour, granulated sugar, salt, lemon zest and vanilla bean paste and blend on high speed until combined, about 30 seconds, stopping the blender to scrape down the sides as needed. Add the melted butter and blend on high speed for 30 seconds.

Remove the pan from the oven and spray the wells with nonstick cooking spray. Working quickly, divide the batter evenly among the prepared wells, filling each about three-fourths full. For each popover, place 4 strawberry slices on the surface of the batter.

Bake the popovers for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (180°C). Continue to bake until the popovers are deep golden brown and the strawberries look slightly dehydrated, 10 to 15 minutes more.

While the popovers are baking, make the mascarpone whipped cream, if desired. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the cream on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. Add the mascarpone cheese, granulated sugar and vanilla and beat until medium peaks form, about 10 seconds.

Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the popovers cool in the pan for 3 minutes, then dust with confectioners’ sugar.  

Using an offset spatula, remove the popovers from the muffin pan. Serve warm with the mascarpone whipped cream, if desired.
