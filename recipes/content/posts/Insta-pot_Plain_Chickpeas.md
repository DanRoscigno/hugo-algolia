# Insta-pot Plain Chickpeas

`Kim Acceptable`

6 cups of water or other liquid

1 pound dried chickpeas 

#### NO-SOAK METHOD:

- Cover the dry chickpeas with 6 cups of water and secure the lid, moving the steam release valve to SEALING. Select the "Manual" or "Pressure Cook" button and cook at high pressure for 50 minutes, then allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes. When the screen reads LO:10, move the steam release valve to VENTING to release the remaining pressure. 
- When the floating valve in the lid drops, it's safe to remove the lid. Test the chickpeas for tenderness by mashing one against the side of the pot with a fork. Use the cooked beans right away, or store them in 1 1/2 cup portions in the fridge or freezer to replace a can of chickpeas in recipes.
