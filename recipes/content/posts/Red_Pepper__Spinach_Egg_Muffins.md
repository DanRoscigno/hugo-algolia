# Red Pepper & Spinach Egg Muffins

`Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable` `Camping`

Serves 12 typical-sized muffins

### Ingredients:

- 12 eggs
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 cup spinach, chopped
- 1/4 cup cheddar, grated
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/8 teaspoon black pepper
- Butter or olive oil, for greasing

### Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F and grease a 12-cup muffin tin. (If you have a silicone muffin tin, would suggest using it as it is easier to remove the muffins.)
2. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and season with salt and pepper. Add chopped bell pepper and spinach, and whisk to combine.
3. Divide egg mixture evenly across the muffin tins, filling them halfway, and sprinkle with cheese. Depending on the size of your eggs you may have a little extra of the mixture, so you can make a few more.
4. Transfer the muffin tin to the oven and bake for 17-20 minutes until the centre of each muffin is set.
5. Once cooked, serve immediately or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
