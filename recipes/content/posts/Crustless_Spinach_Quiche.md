# Crustless Spinach Quiche

`Main Meal` `Breakfasts` `Picnic Fare` `Kim Acceptable` `Gluten Free` `French Inspired`

Serves 6

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained
- 2/3 cup finely chopped fully cooked ham
- 5 large eggs
- 3 cups shredded Muenster or Monterey Jack cheese
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper

**Directions:**

1. In a large skillet, saute onion and mushrooms in oil until tender. Add spinach and ham; cook and stir until the excess moisture is evaporated. Cool slightly. Beat eggs; add cheese and mix well. Stir in spinach mixture and pepper; blend well. Spread evenly into a greased 9-in. pie plate or quiche dish. Bake at 350° for 40-45 minutes or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean.

**Note:** The key to preventing a soggy quiche is to cook it slowly and possibly remove it from the oven early—while the center is still a touch wobbly, so that residual heat can finish the cooking. Also make sure to cook out, dry, or remove any excess moisture from your vegetables and/or meats, which could also contribute to a soggy quiche.
