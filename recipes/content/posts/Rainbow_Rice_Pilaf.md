# Rainbow Rice Pilaf

`Side dish`

**Ingredients:**

2 tablespoons olive oil

1/2 yellow onion, diced 

1/2 cup diced celery (from 1 rib)

1 orange bell pepper, seeded and diced 

1 1/2 cups long-grain rice 

1/2 cup orzo 

2 cloves garlic, minced 

1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 

1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme 

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 

4 cups vegetable broth 

1/2 cup dried cranberries 

1/4 cup toasted sliced almonds 

1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 

**Directions:**

1. Heat the oil in a large deep-sided skillet with a lid over medium-high heat. Add the onions, celery and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are just beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and orzo and cook, stirring constantly, until the orzo begins to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic, oregano, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes.
2. Stir in the vegetable broth, bring to a simmer and then lower heat and cook, covered, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for about 10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and transfer to a serving dish. Top with the cranberries, almonds and parsley. Serve warm.
