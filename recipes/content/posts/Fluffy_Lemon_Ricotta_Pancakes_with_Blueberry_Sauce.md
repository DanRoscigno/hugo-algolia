# Fluffy Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with Blueberry Sauce

`Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable`

Makes 10-12 pancakes

**Ingredients:**

_Blueberry Sauce:_

3 cups blueberries (fresh or frozen)

1/2 cup honey 

1 heaping tablespoon cornstarch

Squeeze fresh lemon juice 

_Pancakes:_

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons sugar 

2 teaspoons baking powder 

1/2 teaspoon baking soda 

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 

3/4 cup ricotta 

1/2 cup milk 

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 

2 large eggs 

Zest and juice of 1 lemon 

Butter and vegetable oil, for cooking 

**Directions:**

1. For the blueberry sauce: Place the blueberries in a small saucepan. Add 1/2 cup water, then stir in the honey. Heat over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a low boil and the blueberries just start to break apart. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons cold water in a small bowl, then add the slurry to the saucepan and bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Turn the heat down and simmer on low heat until the sauce is nicely thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Set aside until ready to serve. (See Cook's Note.)
2. For the pancakes: Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl.
3. Whisk together the ricotta, milk, vanilla, eggs and lemon zest and juice in a separate medium bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined.
4. Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F.
5. Heat about a tablespoon each vegetable oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet (I prefer cast-iron) over medium heat. When the butter is foamy, reduce the heat to medium-low and ladle a heaping 1/4 cup pancake batter into the skillet. Repeat to make 2 more pancakes. Cook until bubbles start to form in the batter and the pancakes are golden underneath, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook the other sides until golden, another 3 minutes. Place the finished pancakes on a sheet tray and hold the oven while you finish cooking the remaining batter, adding more oil and butter as necessary. Serve warm with the blueberry sauce.

### Cook’s Note

Blueberry sauce can be made up to 2 days ahead and stored in the refrigerator. Warm over low heat when ready to use. If the sauce is too thick, add water 1 tablespoon at a time until the desired consistency is reached.
