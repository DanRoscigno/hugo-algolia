`Want to make` `Kid’s Delight`

Makes ~ 24

### **Ingredients:**

###### _Muffins:_

Nonstick cooking spray

1/2 cup buttermilk 

4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

1/4 cup sugar 

1 large egg

1/2 cup yellow cornmeal

1/2 cup all-purpose flour 

1/4 teaspoon baking soda 

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 

4 all-beef hot dogs, cut into 1-inch pieces

###### _Creole Mustard Sauce:_

1/2 cup Creole or grainy mustard

1/4 cup mayonnaise

1 teaspoon honey

1 teaspoon hot sauce 

1/2 teaspoon white wine vinegar

### **Directions:**

###### Special equipment:

 a 24-cup mini muffin pan

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and spray the mini muffin pan with nonstick spray.
2. For the muffins: Whisk together the buttermilk, melted butter, sugar and egg in a medium bowl. In another medium bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, baking soda and salt. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Don’t overmix.
3. Fill each mini muffin cup halfway with the batter. Gently push a piece of hot dog into the batter in each cup, being careful not to push it all the way to the bottom. Bake until the edges just start to brown and the muffins are cooked through, about 10 minutes.
4. For the Creole mustard sauce: Meanwhile, whisk together the mustard, mayonnaise, honey, hot sauce and vinegar in a small bowl.
5. Serve the mini corn dog muffins warm with the mustard sauce.
