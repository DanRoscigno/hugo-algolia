# Spring Onion Pie

`Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable`

Makes ~ 6 servings

**Ingredients:**

- 10 thin spring onions 
- 4 large eggs, lightly beaten 
- 1 cup milk 
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour 
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
- ½ teaspoon baking powder 
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper 
- 2 tablespoons butter 
- 5 ounces Gruyere cheese, cubed

## **Directions:**

Preheat oven to 400°. Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet in oven. Trim roots from onions; discard roots. Chop half of onions.

Whisk together eggs and milk. Sift together flour and next 3 ingredients. Gradually add flour mixture to egg mixture, whisking rapidly 20 to 30 seconds or just until blended and smooth. (There should be no lumps.) Stir in chopped onions. Let stand 5 minutes.

Carefully remove hot skillet from oven. Add butter, and let stand until butter is melted. Place skillet over medium-high heat, and pour batter into skillet. Arrange cheese and remaining whole onions over top of batter, and cook 30 seconds to 1 minute or until edges begin to set.

Transfer skillet to top oven rack, and bake at 400° for 22 to 25 minutes or until golden brown and puffy. (Outside edges should be crispy, and inside texture should resemble a custard popover. Pie will deflate quickly.) Serve immediately.
