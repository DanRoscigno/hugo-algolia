# Triple-Ginger Cheesecake

`Cheesecakes` `Want to make`

Servings: 10-12Â  Â  Â  

**Ingredients:**

_For the crust:_ 

8 oz. gingersnaps, finely crushed (2 cups of crumbs) 

3 Tbs. granulated sugar 

7 Tbs. unsalted butter, melted 

_For the filling:_ 

3 8-oz. packages cream cheese, at room temperature 

3/4 cup crÃ¨me fraÃ®che 

2 Tbs. all-purpose flour 

Table salt 

1-1/4 cups granulated sugar 

2 Tbs. finely chopped crystallized ginger 

2 Tbs. finely chopped fresh ginger 

1 Tbs. pure vanilla extract 

4 large eggs, at room temperature 

_Homemade CrÃ¨me Fraiche:_

1 cup whipping cream mixed with 2 tablespoons buttermilk.

Combine well in glass jar and cover.

Let stand at room temperature (about 70 degrees F.) for 8 to 24 hours, or until thickened.

Stir well and refrigerate.

Use within 10 days.

**Directions:Â  Â  Â**  

_Make the crust:_ 

Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 375Â°F.

In a medium bowl, stir together the gingersnap crumbs and 3 Tbs. granulated sugar. Mix in the melted butter until the crumbs are evenly moist and clump together slightly. Transfer the mixture to a 9-inch springform pan and press evenly onto the bottom and about 2 inches up the sides of the pan (to press, use plastic wrap or a flat-bottom measuring cup). Bake until the crust is fragrant and slightly darkened, 9 to 12 minutes. Let the pan cool on a rack. Lower the oven temperature to 300Â°F.

_Fill and bake the cheesecake:_ 

In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese, crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, flour, and a pinch of table salt on medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the paddle frequently, until very smooth and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Make sure the cheese has no lumps. Add the 1-1/4 cups granulated sugar and continue beating until well blended and smooth.

Add the crystallized ginger, fresh ginger, and vanilla, and beat until blended, about 30 seconds. Add the eggs one at a time, beating just until blended. (Donâ€™t overbeat once the eggs have been added or the cheesecake will puff too much and crack as it cools.) Pour the filling into the cooled crust and smooth the top.

Bake at 300Â°F until the center jiggles like Jell-O when nudged, 55 to 65 minutes. The cake will be slightly puffed around the edges, and the center will still look moist. Set on a rack and cool completely. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 8 hours and up to 3 days. The cake can also be frozen at this point for up to 1 month (see make-ahead tip, below).

Unclasp and remove the side of the springform pan and run a long, thin metal spatula under the bottom crust. Carefully slide the cake onto a flat serving plate. To cut, run a thin knife under hot water, wipe it dry, and cut the cake into slices, heating and wiping the knife after every slice.
