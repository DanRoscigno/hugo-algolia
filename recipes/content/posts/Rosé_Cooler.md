# Rosé Cooler

`Drinks` `Picnic Fare` `Summer`

Makes one drink

**INGREDIENTS:**

- 4 ounces dry to demi-sec rosé
- ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
- 2 ounces soda water
- 4 thyme sprigs
- Crème de cassis (optional)*

**PREPARATION:**

1. In an ice-filled lowball glass, combine the rosé and lime juice. Top with soda water. Place the thyme in one hand and use the other to lightly slap the stems. Add to the glass. Depending on how sweet your rosé is, finish with a few drops of cassis. Serve immediately.

***Note:**

If you decide to pour a dry rosé, turn to crème de cassis to sweeten the final glass. If you opt for a sweeter-leaning demi-sec rosé, turn the page — and skip the cassis, so your drink doesn’t skew too saccharine.
