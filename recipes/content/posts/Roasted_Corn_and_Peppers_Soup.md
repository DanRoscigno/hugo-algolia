# Roasted Corn and Peppers Soup

`Soups` `Kim Acceptable` `Quick` `Summer` `Mexican/Cuban/Latin Inspired`

**Ingredients:**

6-8 medium ears of fresh corn

1 large poblano pepper 

1 medium red bell pepper

Olive oil

2 Tbsp butter

1 medium red onion

2-3 cloves of garlic

1 qt chicken broth

1/2-3/4 tsp chipotle chili powder

Kosher salt

Pepper

**Directions:**

Turn oven on to 375 degrees. 

Remove the corn kernels from the cob, but do not throw the cobs out. Mince the two peppers into 1/4 inch pieces, not using any seeds. Place the peppers and corn on a sheet pan and toss with some olive oil. Cook at 375 for about 25 minutes, tossing a couple of times while cooking. 

Pour 1 qt of chicken broth into a heavy soup pot and add the corn cobs. Leave pot uncovered, put on medium-high, and bring broth to a boil. Turn down to simmer, cover, and let simmer for 20 minutes. Take the cobs out and throw out.

Dice red onion and saut√© with garlic in butter. Add onion mixture to the broth, along with salt and chipotle chili powder. When the corn and peppers are roasted, remove from oven and add to the broth. Let the broth simmer for another 20-25 minutes. Serve immediately!
