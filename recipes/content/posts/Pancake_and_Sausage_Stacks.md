# Pancake and Sausage Stacks

`Breakfasts`

**Ingredients:**

_Sausages:_

1 pound ground pork

2 teaspoons brown sugar 

3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 

1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary

1/2 teaspoon minced fresh sage

1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme

_Big Fluffy Pancake Mix:_

4 large eggs, separated

1/4 cup granulated sugar 

1/2 cup milk 

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 

3/4 cup store-bought pancake mix 

_Big Fluffy Pancakes and Sausage:_

Pat of unsalted butter, plus more for serving

Nonstick cooking spray, for the ring molds 

Maple syrup, for serving

**Directions:**

_Special equipment:_

eight 3-inch round (2-inch tall) ring molds

1. For the sausages: Mix the pork, brown sugar, salt, rosemary, sage and thyme in a bowl until well combined. Shape into four 4-inch-wide and 1/4-inch-thick circular patties.
2. For the big fluffy pancake mix: In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. Continue whisking and gradually add the granulated sugar. Continue whisking until all the sugar is dissolved and the mixture forms stiff peaks.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, milk, melted butter and vanilla extract until smooth. Add the pancake mix and stir to combine. Carefully fold in the egg white mixture, taking care not to overmix.
4. For the big fluffy pancakes and sausage: Preheat a large nonstick pan over low heat and add the butter.
5. Spray 3-inch round (2-inch tall) ring molds with cooking spray. Place the ring molds in your preheated pan and use a ladle to fill the molds two-thirds of the way with the pancake mix. Place a cover over the pan and let the pancakes cook for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and use tongs and a rubber spatula to help flip the ring molds with the pancakes. Cover and continue cooking for about 7 minutes more.
6. Meanwhile, cook your sausage in a skillet over medium-low heat until the pork is fully cooked, about 4 minutes on each side.
7. Remove the ring molds with the pancakes using tongs and a rubber spatula. The pancakes should slide right out. Add the sausage underneath your pancakes for even more height. Serve with butter and maple syrup.
