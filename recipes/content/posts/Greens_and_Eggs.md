# Greens and Eggs

`Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable`

Serves 4

**INGREDIENTS:**

_FOR THE GREENS:_

- One (8- to 10-ounce) bunch mature spinach, washed and dried
- One (8- to 10-ounce) bunch Swiss chard, washed and dried
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small yellow onion (5 ounces), chopped
- 1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
- 2 scallions, chopped, dark-green parts reserved for garnish
- 1 teaspoon finely minced, seeded Scotch bonnet or habanero pepper, or to taste
- 3 cloves garlic, minced or finely grated
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons water

_FOR THE EGGS:_

- 2 teaspoons olive oil or butter
- 4 large eggs
- Fine salt
- Freshly ground black pepper

**DIRECTIONS:**

Make the greens: Trim any tough brown ends from the stems of the spinach and Swiss chard. Cut the spinach leaves and tender stems into 3/4-inch pieces and transfer to a large bowl. Tear or cut the Swiss chard leaves away from their stems and center ribs (donâ€™t throw away the stems/ribs). Chop the leaves into 3/4-inch pieces and transfer them to a separate bowl. Dice the chard stems into 1/4-inch pieces and keep those separate as well.

In a large, deep, lidded skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the onion, bell pepper, scallions (white and light-green parts only), and the Scotch bonnet or habanero pepper (1 teaspoon of the hot pepper will yield a mild-medium heat). Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the chard stems and cook, stirring, for another 2 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until aromatic, another 30 seconds. 

Add the chard leaves and the water, stir, then cover and cook until the chard is wilted, about 2 minutes. Add the spinach, re-cover, and cook until the greens are wilted but still bright green, another 2 minutes. Uncover and remove from the heat.

Make the eggs: In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, heat the oil or melt the butter. Add the eggs and cook to your liking. 

To serve, place about 3/4 cup of the greens onto each serving plate. Top each with an egg, season to taste with salt and pepper, and garnish with the reserved scallion greens. Serve hot.

**Storage Notes:** Refrigerate leftover greens for up to 4 days; serve at room temperature or reheat.
