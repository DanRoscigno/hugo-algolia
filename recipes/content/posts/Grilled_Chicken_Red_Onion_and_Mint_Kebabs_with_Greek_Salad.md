 ![Grilled Chicken, Red Onion, and Mint Kebabs with Greek Salad](http://www.epicurious.com/images/recipesmenus/2001/2001_july/105308_116.jpg)   Ingredients  

  1 1/2 pounds skinless boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch pieces

4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

4 garlic cloves, crushed

1 teaspoon dried mint

1 teaspoon dried oregano

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon ground black pepper

2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

1 bunch fresh mint

1 red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces

8 12-inch metal skewers

Greek Salad:

 * 3/4 pound tomatoes, seeded, diced (about 2 cups)

 * 2 cups diced seeded peeled cucumber (from about 1 large)

 * 1 cup diced red bell pepper (from about 1 large)

 * 1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives or other brine-cured black olives, halved

 * 1/4 cup diced red onion

 * 3 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley

 * 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

 * 1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

 * 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

 * 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (about 2 ounces)

  

   Directions  

  Mix chicken, 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, mint, oregano, salt, and pepper in medium bowl. Let marinate 30 minutes. Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons oil and lemon juice in small bowl to blend.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Pull off large mint leaves from stems. Alternate chicken, onion, and mint leaves on skewers; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill until chicken is just cooked through, turning and basting occasionally with oil-lemon mixture, about 9 minutes. Serve Greek Salad alongside. 

Greek Salad:

Toss first 9 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Gently mix in cheese. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)
