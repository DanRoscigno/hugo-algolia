# Ginger Ice Cream

`Ice Creams`

**Ingredients**       

4 large egg yolks

1/2 cup sugar

1/4 cup coarsely grated peeled fresh gingerroot

2 tablespoons water

2 cups half-and-half

1 cup heavy cream

1 teaspoon vanilla

1/2 cup crystallized ginger*

*available at some supermarkets and specialty foods shops.

        

**Directions**       

           In a large bowl lightly whisk yolks. In a 3-quart heavy saucepan cook sugar, fresh gingerroot, and water over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add half-and-half and bring to a simmer. Add hot half-and-half mixture to yolks in a slow stream, whisking, and pour into pan. Cook custard over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until a thermometer registers 170°F. (Do not let boil.)

Pour custard through a sieve into cleaned bowl and stir in cream and vanilla. Cool custard. Chill custard, its surface covered with plastic wrap, until cold, at least 3 hours, and up to 1 day.

Finely chop crystallized ginger. Freeze custard in an ice-cream maker, adding crystallized ginger three fourths of way through freezing process. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden. Ice cream may be made 1 week ahead.
