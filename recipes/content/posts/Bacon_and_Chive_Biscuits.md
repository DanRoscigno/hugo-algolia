# Bacon and Chive Biscuits

`Breads`

Makes 12 2-inch biscuits

**Ingredients:** 

1/2 lb. bacon (about 8 slices)

1 1/2 cups plus 3 Tbsps all purpose flour

1 Tbsp baking powder 

1 Tbsp sugar

1/4 tsp salt

1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, chilled

1/4 cup shortening, chilled

1/2 cup minced fresh chives

1/2 cup milk

**Directions:** 

Place rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

In a large skillet cook the bacon over medium heat until crispy on both sides, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Finely chop and set aside. 

Sifte the dry ingredients together into a large bowl. Stir well. Cut the butter and shortening into small pieces and add to flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter, crumble the fats into the flour mixture until the fats are pea-sized and the mixture resembles cornmeal. Add the bacon and chives. Add the milk and mix the dough until it just comes together, making sure not to overmix. 

Knead the dough gently on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out the dough to 1/2” thickness. Be sure it is 1/2” thickness or biscuits will be too dry and if too think they won’t cook completely. Using a 2” cutter, cut out the biscuits and on an ungreased cookie sheet. **The biscuits can be made several hours ahead of time; cover and refrigerate.** 

Bake for 14-15 minutes, or until the biscuits begin to turn a pale shade of golden brown. If the biscuits come straight out of the refrigerator they will need to bake for closer to 19-20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temp.
