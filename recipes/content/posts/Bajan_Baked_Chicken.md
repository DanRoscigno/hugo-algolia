# Bajan Baked Chicken

`Main Meal` `Kim Acceptable` `Island Inspired`

Makes 4 servings

**Ingredients:**

10 green onions

1 medium sized onion, diced

1 bell pepper, seeded and diced

1 scotch-bonnet pepper or jalape√±o pepper, seeded and minced

3-4 cloves garlic, minced

2 Tablespoons butter, softened

1 Tablespoon fresh thyme leaves

1 Tablespoon minced fresh parsley

1/4 cup lime juice

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

4 chicken thighs (can split with drumsticks if you wish)

4 split chicken breasts

**Directions:**

In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, place all of the ingredients except the chicken. Process for 30 seconds, forming a paste. Scrape the sides at least once during the processing. Place the chicken in a bowl, covering it with paste. Force the paste into any crevices in the chicken. Marinate for 4-6 hours. 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Place the chicken in a baking dish in a single layer and bake for 45 minutes, until the meat pulls away easily from the bone. Turn the chicken after 20 minutes and baste with pan juices.
