    1 Tbsp. lemon juice
    1/2 tsp. kosher salt
    1/3 cup olive oil
    3 Tbsp. pistachios (finely chopped, plus more for topping)
    3 Tbsp. green onions (finely chopped)
    3 Tbsp. fresh dill (finely chopped)
    1 head bibb lettuce (or Boston lettuce, leaves separated)
    2 golden beets (roasted,* halved, and thinly sliced)
    8 oz. strawberries (whole fresh, hulled and sliced, about 2 cups)
    2 watermelon radishes (peeled and thinly sliced)
    1/3 cup white balsamic vinega**r** (or balsamic vinegar)
- 2 oz. ricotta salata (finely shredded, substitute feta cheese, if desired)

**Directions:**

For vinaigrette: In a small bowl whisk together vinegar, honey, lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp. salt. Gradually whisk in olive oil. 

Stir in pistachios, green onions, and dill; set aside.

For salad: Arrange lettuce leaves on a large platter. Top with rows of roasted beets, strawberries, and radishes.

Sprinkle with cheese and additional pistachios. Serve with dressing on the side.

***To Roast Beets:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Place beets on a piece of heavy foil. Bring up sides of foil around beets; fold ends to enclose. Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 1 hour or until tender. Cool. Slip off skins and continue to prep as called for in the ingredient list.

Note: What is ricotta salata?

Don't let the name fool you, [ricotta salata](https://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/cooking-basics/mediterranean-cheese-guide/)is quite different from ricotta. "Salata" means salty and indicates the process used to make the cheese. Ricotta salata starts as ricotta, but is salted and pressed then aged for about three months to create the firm crumbly cheese. It's similar in flavor to feta, but less salty. It's sweeter and nutty when the aging process is complete.
