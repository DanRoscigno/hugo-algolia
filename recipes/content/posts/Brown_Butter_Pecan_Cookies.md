# Brown Butter Pecan Cookies

`Want to make` `Picnic Fare` `Cookies`

**INGREDIENTS:**

 1 1/2 cups pecan halves, finely chopped

 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter

 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

 2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch

 1 teaspoon salt

 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

 1 teaspoon baking soda

 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter, melted until browned

 1 cup dark brown sugar, packed

 1/2 cup granulated sugar

 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

 2 large eggs, at room temperature

 16 pecan halves, for decoration, optional

 

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

 Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in chopped pecans and cook until lightly toasted, for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.

 In a large bowl whisk together flour, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda. Set aside.

 Melt 2 sticks (8 ounces) butter in a skillet over medium heat; continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. 

Remove pan from heat and pour butter into a large, heatproof mixing bowl. 

Add sugars and whisk well to combine. Stir in vanilla. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until combined.

 Fold in the flour, stirring until just combined.

 Fold in the toasted buttered pecans.

 Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, and up to 2 days.

 Preheat oven to 375F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

 Scoop 3 tablespoon sized rounds of dough onto the prepared sheet, leaving 2 inches in between each cookie for spreading. Sprinkle warm cookies with a little granulated sugar, if desired.Â  Firmly press a pecan half on top of each ball of cookie dough, bake in preheated oven for 9 minutes, or until edges are set and the center is still a little soft.

 Allow cookies to cool on the pan for 15 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.
