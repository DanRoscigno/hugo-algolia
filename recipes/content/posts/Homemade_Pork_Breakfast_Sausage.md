# Homemade Pork Breakfast Sausage

`Breakfasts`

Makes. 10-12 patties

**Ingredients:**

2 pounds ground pork

2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 

2 teaspoons rubbed sage 

2 teaspoons kosher salt 

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 

1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika 

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 

Pinch crushed red pepper flakes 

2 tablespoons unsalted butter 

**Directions:**

1. Place the pork in a large bowl and add the brown sugar, sage, salt, garlic powder, smoked paprika, black pepper and red pepper flakes. Mix well using your hands. Form patties from heaping 1/4 cups of the mixture, about 1/3-inch thick.
2. Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the sausage patties in two batches until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F, about 5 minutes per side. Serve warm with eggs or pancakes. (See Cook's Note.)

### Cook’s Note

Sausage patties can be cooked, cooled and then frozen. Thaw and reheat in the microwave, or on the stovetop in a skillet over medium heat.
