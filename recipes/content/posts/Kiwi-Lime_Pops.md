# Kiwi-Lime Pops

`Desserts` `Want to make` `Picnic Fare` `Kid’s Delight` `Summer` `Island Inspired`

**Ingredients:**

- 6 kiwi fruits, divided
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup fresh lime juice

**Directions:**

1. Cut 5 kiwi in half crosswise and scoop flesh from skins with a spoon. Blend with sugar and lime juice in a blender until pureed, about 15 seconds.
2. Transfer to a measuring cup with a spout and pour into 6 (3-ounce) flat ice pop molds, dividing evenly.
3. Peel remaining kiwi and thinly slice crosswise into 12 slices. Submerge 2 slices in each mold, arranging them so 1 slice presses against each of the mold's wider sides. Cover molds, insert sticks between the slices, and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours and up to 2 weeks.
4. ## **Cook's Note:**
    To showcase the kiwi slices in these, use flat rather than cylindrical molds.
