# Susanâ€™s Potato Salad

`Picnic Fare` `Side dish`

**Ingredients:**

5lbs red potatoes, halved or quartered

4 hard boiled eggs

4 lg. green onions (both green and white part)

2 Tbsp vinegar 

Salt pepper

Celery seed

Sweet Paprika

_Dressing:_

Mayo 2 cups

3/4 cup sour cream

~1/4 cup yellow mustard

**Directions:**

Best made the day before so flavors can meld. Boil potatoes with their skins on and then skins should be removed before preparing. Boil eggs and let cool. Finely chop the green onions and reserve the green tops for decoration. 

When the potatoes are slightly cooled, but still warm, add the vinegar to the potatoes. Add seasonings. Prepare the dressing and mix into the salad. Refrigerate overnight and taste for any needed adjustment.
