# Norwegian Pancakes with Pickled Jalapeños

`Breakfasts`

Makes ~ 16 pancakes depending on size

**Ingredients:**

- 3 cups milk
- 2 cups flour
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 eggs
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- Extra butter for frying
- Pickled jalapeños 
- Powdered sugar

**Instructions:**

1. Whisk together milk and flour with a wire whisk until smooth and no lumps remain.
2. Add sugar, salt, and vanilla, and whisk into the batter.
3. Add the eggs, and whisk only until blended together.
4. Let sit for 20 minutes.
5. Mix in melted butter.
6. To fry, heat skillet over medium heat until hot enough for a pat of butter to sizzle. Swirl the butter around in the skillet.
7. Pour a small amount of batter in the center of the skillet, then quickly tilt it to all sides until it covers as much of the bottom as possible. Keep tilting until it won't spread out anymore. Quickly add some pickled jalapeños. 
8. Let the pancake fry over medium heat until browned underneath, flip, then brown on the other side as well. It should take less than a minute to fry each side.
9. Remove from skillet and keep warm on a plate covered with a towel.
10. Repeat with remaining batter, adding pancakes to the plate to form a stack.
11. Adjust the amount of batter as needed as you fry more pancakes. The pancakes should be very thin. Sprinkle powdered sugar over each pancake. Serve with warmed maple syrup or honey with melted butter.
