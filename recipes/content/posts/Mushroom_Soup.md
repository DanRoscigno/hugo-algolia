# Mushroom Soup

`Soups` `Kim Acceptable` `Quick` `French Inspired`

**Ingredients:**

- 1/4 cup (½stick) butter
- 1sprig fresh thyme or 1 tsp dried
- 3 or 4 shallots ~1 cup), chopped
- 3 cloves minced garlic
- 20 oz. fresh baby Bella mushrooms, sliced (a variety is nice)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- ⅓cup sherry 
- 5cups chicken stock
- 1cup whole milk or half n half 
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves 

**Directions:**

1. Put the butter in a large pot that can later be covered over medium heat. When it melts, add the herb, onions and garlic and sauté, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. 
2. Turn the heat to medium high, and add the fresh mushrooms. 
3. Add the sherry or Madeira to the pot and cook, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom as the liquor starts to bubble. Add the stock or soaking liquid and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a steady simmer and cook, covered, until flavors have melded, about 15 minutes.
    Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook until the mushrooms have given off their liquid and begun to brown, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Discard the fresh thyme herb, if you used fresh. Reduce the heat to low. 
5. Add the milk/cream; stir to combine and let simmer for a few minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning; add parsley and serve.
