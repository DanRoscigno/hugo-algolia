- crushed peanuts
- green onions

### Instructions:

_MARINADE:_ In a medium bowl, whisk Thai Peanut Pineapple Chicken Marinade/Sauce ingredients together. Add 1/4 cup of this Marinade and 3 tablespoons olive oil to a large freezer bag along with chicken. Marinate in the refrigerator 1-4 hours.

**Can either grill or cook in the oven:**

_TO GRILL:_ (Soak wooden skewers at least 30 minutes in water before grilling)

- When ready to cook, generously grease grill and heat to medium-high heat. Drain marinade from chicken and thread chicken and pineapple onto skewers.
- Grill on one side for about 5 minutes or until slightly charred. Flip and grill the other side until chicken is cooked through and slightly charred.

_TO OVEN BROIL:_ (Soak wooden skewers at least 30 minutes in water before broiling) 

- Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly spray with nonstick cooking spray. 
- Add the skewers in a single layer and broil, turning every 5 minutes until cooked through, about 10- 15 minutes depending on thickness of chicken.

_THAI PEANUT SAUCE:_ 

- Add reserved Thai Peanut Pineapple Sauce to a small saucepan and whisk in cornstarch and coconut milk. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 1 minute. 
- Remove from heat and stir in peanut butter. Sauce/Dip should be thick but spreadable. If sauce is too thick, whisk in some coconut milk or water to reach desired consistency. If too thin, return to a simmer until thickened. 
- Taste and add Sriracha, lime, brown sugar to taste.
- Brush grilled kebabs with Sauce and use remaining Sauce as a dip OR after brushing with Sauce, whisk in some water to thin Sauce and pour over chicken and pineapple with rice.

_Garnish:_

Garnish with crushed peanuts, green onions and freshly squeezed lime juice (optional) and salt as needed.*

**Best served with rice.**

### Notes

*The need or amount of salt greatly varies between peanut butters, so salt to taste. **Total time does not include marinating chicken.

*****DO NOT USE** fresh [pineapple juice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Z6XCF6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=carlscravi0a-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B003Z6XCF6&linkId=61bb7ee9a7b3daef315b6b2b679023c7) as it contains the enzyme bromelain which will leave your chicken mushy.  In CANNED pineapple, however, the bromelain is extracted so the juice will infuse your chicken with flavor without becoming mushy.
