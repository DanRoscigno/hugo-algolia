Serves 10-12

**Ingredients:**

- 1(6- to 7-lb.) bone-in leg of lamb, trimmed and patted dry
- 1 Tbsp finely chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 Tbsp finely chopped fresh thyme
- 1 1/4 cups olive oil, divided
- 1 Tbsp plus 1/2 tsp. grated garlic (from 4 cloves), divided
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 6 Tbsps kosher salt, divided
- 2 cups loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
- 1 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves
- 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar

**Directions:**

Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Score the fatty top of the lamb 5 times (1/4 inch deep and 4 inches long). Stir together rosemary, thyme, 1/4 cup of the oil, and 1 tablespoon of the garlic. Rub mixture all over lamb. Season with pepper and 5 teaspoons of the salt. Place on wire rack on baking sheet. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 325째F. Cook lamb until a thermometer inserted in thickest portion of meat registers 125째F to 130째F for medium doneness, 1 hour, 45 minutes. Remove from oven; rest 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, increase oven temperature to 450째F. Return lamb to oven; cook until meat is browned and a crust has formed, 10 to 15 minutes. Rest on wire rack 15 minutes.

Process parsley, mint, vinegar, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic in a food processor 20 seconds. With machine running, pour remaining 1 cup oil into mixture until blended, 20 seconds. Stir in remaining 1 teaspoon salt.

Slice lamb against the grain; serve with sauce.
