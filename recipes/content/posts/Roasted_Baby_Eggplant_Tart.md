Serves 8-10

*see gluten free flaky pie crust recipe

**Ingredients:**

1 pre-baked pie crust (beautiful baked in a heart shaped pan)

1 lb. Of Baby eggplants, cut in half

1/4 cup olive oil

3 garlic cloves, crushed

Dash Tabasco

1/2 cup cherry tomatoes 

1/2 cup black olives, pitted

Handful fresh basil, the smallest leaves reserved for garnish

4 eggs, small

1 cup heavy cream

1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly shredded 

Salt and freshly ground pepper

**Directions:**

Baste the eggplant halves generously in the olive oil, crushed garlic, and Tabasco, and season with salt and pepper. Place under a very hot broiler for 10 minutes, turning over at least once, until the cut side is a dark golden color and the skins are slightly charred. 

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F

Arrange the eggplant halves in the pre baked pie shell, cut side up. Fill the gaps with the cherry tomatoes, olives, and basil. Mix the eggs, cream, and Parmesan together and season. Pour all over, taking care to leave as much of the vegetables exposed as possible. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until set, but still moist. Serve hot or warm.
