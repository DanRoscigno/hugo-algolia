# Lemon Biscotti

`Gifts` `Cookies` `Italian Inspired`

Makes about 48 

Ingredients:

3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 

1 tsp baking powder 

1/2 tsp salt 

2 large eggs, at room temperature, plus 1 extra, for the egg wash

1 cup plus 3 Tbsps sugar

1/4 cup extra light olive oil

Peeled zest of 3 large lemons, finely chopped

1/2 cup milk 

Directions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. 

Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt and sift into a bowl. In the bowl of an electric mixer, whisk 2 eggs until foamy. Gradually add the sugar, whisking constantly, until the mixture is thick and very pale yellow, about 3-4 minutes. Whisk in the oil, and then the lemon zest. 

Add the flour mixture, alternately with the milk, beginning and ending with flour. Transfer dough to a well floured surface and divide into four equal parts. Shape them into logs, about 1 1/4 “ thick. Use more flour if necessary. Place the logs 2-inches apart on one of the prepared sheet pans. Mix the extra egg with 2 tsp’s water and brush over logs. Bake until they are golden and firm, about 25 minutes, turning the baking sheet back to front halfway through baking time. Cool on the sheet on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Leave the oven on. 

Using a bread knife, cut the logs diagonally into 1/2 “ slices. Lay the slices on the baking sheets and bake 15 minutes. Turn the slices over and bake another 15 minutes, or until the biscotti are golden on both sides. Cool on wire racks, then store in airtight container.
