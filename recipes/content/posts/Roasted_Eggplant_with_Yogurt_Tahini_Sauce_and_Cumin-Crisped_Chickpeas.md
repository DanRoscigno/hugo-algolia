# Roasted Eggplant with Yogurt Tahini Sauce and Cumin-Crisped Chickpeas

`Main Meal` `Kim Acceptable` `Quick` `Mediterranean Inspired`

Makes 4-6 servings

**Ingredients:**

1 1/4 cups* (from a 15 oz. Can) cooked chickpeas, drained, patted dry on paper towels (*_I used a 29 oz can of chickpeas because I love them and just adjust their oil and seasonings accordingly_)

5 T olive oil

Coarse or kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

1/2 tsp ground cumin

3 pounds small eggplants (Italian style eggplants if you can find them-4-7 oz. each)

_Yogurt-Tahini Sauce:_

1/3 cup tahini paste

2/3 cup full fat, thick plain Greek yogurt

3 T lemon juice

2 garlic cloves, minced

1/2 tsp salt

About 2/3 cup cold water

2 T coarsely chopped fresh flat leaf parsley 

**Directions:**

_Crisp Chickpeas:_

Preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Toss the chickpeas with 2 T olive oil, 1/4 tsp coarse salt, freshly ground black pepper and ground cumin. Spread them on a baking sheet, and roast on top rack for 30-40 minutes, rolling them around on tray from time to time, until they turn browned and crisp. (If you use fresh chickpeas and not canned, they cook/crisp faster.)

_Roast Eggplant:_

Brush a large baking sheet or roasting pan with a generous Tablespoon of oil. Half the eggplants lengthwise, arrange them, cut side up, in one layer on oiled pan. Brush the cut sides lightly with a tiny amount of oil, and sprinkle them with generously with salt and black pepper. Roast for 15 minutes until they are browned on top. Carefully flip the eggplants so their cut sides are against the pan, and roast another 15 minutes, until they are bronzed underneath and tender throughout. (If you are using larger eggplants, you may need to adjust cooking times slightly.)

_Yogurt-Tahini Sauce:_

Whisk together tahini, yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, and salt; the mixture will become very thick and stiff. Add water, a tablespoon at a time, until mixture is smooth, with a thick but pourable consistency. 

_Putting together:_

Arrange the eggplant sections, cut side up, on a large platter. Dollop each piece generously with the yogurt-tahini sauce. Sprinkle with crisped chickpeas and parsley.
