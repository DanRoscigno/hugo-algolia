# Pumpkin Pancakes

`Breakfasts` `Fall`

Makes 10-12 pancakes

**Ingredients:**

- 1½ cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- Heaping ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- 1¼ cups unsweetened almond milk, at room temperature
- ½ cup canned pumpkin puree
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil or butter, plus more for brushing
- 1½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- Maple syrup, for serving
- Chopped toasted pecans, optional, for serving

**Instructions:**

- In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger, nutmeg, and salt.
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond milk, pumpkin, brown sugar, egg, coconut oil, and vanilla.
- Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix—a few lumps are ok.
- Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Brush the skillet with oil and use a ⅓-cup measuring cup to pour the batter into the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side, or until bubbles form and the pancakes are golden brown underneath. Flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown. Turn the heat to low as needed so that the middles cook through without burning the outsides.
- Serve with maple syrup and pecans, if desired.
