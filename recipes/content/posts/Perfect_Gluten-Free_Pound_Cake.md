# Perfect Gluten-Free Pound Cake

`Desserts` `Gluten Free`

**Ingredients:**

_DRY INGREDIENTS:_

- 1 ⅓ cup gluten-free 1:1 all-purpose 
-  1 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt

_OTHER:_

-  1 ¼ cups white sugar
- 2 tsps lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 4 large eggs
- 4 ozs cream cheese-softened to room temperature
- ½ cup butter melted

**Instructions:**

- Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease a 8 ½ by 4 ½-inch loaf pan and lightly coat the pan with flour. Tap out any excess flour.
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.
- In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the sugar, lemon juice, pure vanilla extract, eggs and cream cheese. Mix on medium speed for about 1-2 minute until well combined.
- With the mixer running on low, slowly pour in the melted butter. Continue to mix on low and add the dry ingredients a little at a time until fully incorporated. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl and mix again until the batter is totally smooth.
- Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 15 minutes at 350F, then reduce the oven temperature to 325F and continue baking for 35-40 minutes. Bake until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
- Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then run a knife down the sides of the pan and turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
- Let the cake cool for 2 hours before slicing. Enjoy!
