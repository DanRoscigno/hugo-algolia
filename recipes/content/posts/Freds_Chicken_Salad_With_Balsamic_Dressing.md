### INGREDIENTS:

_FOR THE CHICKEN:_

- 14-pound chicken (or a store-bought rotisserie chicken, in which case skip to the dressing below)
- 1 ½tablespoons salt
- ½ bunch fresh thyme
- 1 lemon, quartered
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 Tbsp  extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp ground black pepper

_FOR THE DRESSING:_

- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
- ¼ cup Dijon mustard
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 2 Tsps sugar (optional)
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- ½ tsp ground black pepper
- 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil

_FOR THE SALAD:_

- 1 cup fresh pears diced in 1-inch pieces
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice
- 4 large handfuls mixed greens, such as a boxed mix with fresh herbs
- 1 cup string beans cut in 1-inch pieces, blanched (from about 1/4 pound beans; see note)
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- ½ cup minced onion
- 2 ripe avocados, cut into 1-inch cubes

### PREPARATION:

1. Roast the chicken (if you’re using a cooked, store-bought chicken, skip this step): Heat oven to 350 degrees. Place a rack in a roasting pan. Rub 1 tablespoon salt around the inside of the cavity, then stuff it with the thyme, lemon and garlic. Tie the legs closed with cooking twine. Rub olive oil over the entire bird, and sprinkle with 1/2 tablespoon salt and the black pepper. Place on the rack and roast for 72 to 80 minutes. After 72 minutes, begin testing for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into the leg, close to the bone. The chicken is done when the thermometer reads 165 degrees. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.
2. When cool enough to handle, remove the skin from the chicken. Use your hands to remove all the meat (remember, it will be hotter internally) and shred into 2-inch strips. If you’re not going to make the salad for a few hours, place the meat in the refrigerator, but be sure to remove it and let come to room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before serving, to bring out the best flavor.
3. Make the dressing: Place all the ingredients except the oil in a food processor and pulse for about 30 seconds, until everything is combined. With the machine on low, slowly drizzle in the oil until dressing is emulsified.
4. Assemble the salad: Drizzle pears with lemon juice to prevent them from browning. In a large mixing bowl, combine pears, greens, beans, tomatoes, onion, avocado and half the chicken meat. Add some of the dressing and toss to make sure everything is lightly coated, adding more dressing if needed. Divide the mixture equally among 4 or 6 plates. Lay the rest of the chicken on top and serve immediately, passing the remaining dressing in case people want to add more.

#### **Tip**

- _To blanch the string beans, bring a small saucepan filled with about 2 inches of water to a simmer. Add the cut beans and cook 1 to 2 minutes (less for crunchier beans), until bright green and just beginning to soften. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beans to a plate to cool._
