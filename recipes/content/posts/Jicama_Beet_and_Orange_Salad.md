# Jicama, Beet, and Orange Salad

`Salads` `Side dish` `Kim Acceptable` `Island Inspired`

Servings: 8      

**Ingredients:**

4 large beets, peeled and green tops removed

Coarse salt

3 seedless oranges

5 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice

2 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice

1 teaspoon sugar

1/4 cup peanut oil, preferably unrefined

1 medium jicama, brown skin and exterior layer removed, cut into 4-by-2-inch slices

4 cups wild baby arugula

2/3 cup roasted, salted peanuts

1 piece sugar cane (3 to 4 inches), peeled and cut lengthwise into slivers

**Directions:**

Fill a small saucepan with water. Bring to a boil and add salt. When water returns to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer. Add beets and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool. Cut beets into 4-by-2-inch slices; place in a large bowl. 

Using a zester or vegetable peeler, zest the rind of one of the oranges. Finely chop and add to another large bowl along with the lime juice, orange juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, sugar, and oil. Mix well and pour over beets; let stand 1 hour. 

Remove peel and pith from the oranges using a sharp paring knife. Carefully cut between membranes to remove segments; set aside. 

Add jicama and orange segments to the beet mixture and season with salt. Place arugula on a serving platter and place beet mixture on top. Sprinkle with peanuts and garnish with sugar can cane.
