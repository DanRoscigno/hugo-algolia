# Roasted Strawberry Jam

`Preserves and Jams`

## **Ingredients**

- 2 pounds very ripe strawberries, washed and quartered 
- 1 cup white sugar 
- 2 tsp vanilla extract

## **Instructions**

1. Toss the strawberries, sugar and vanilla together in a glass baking dish. 
2. Roast in the oven at 350 degrees F stirring occasionally until the jam reduces and the juice almost completely boils off. (Approximately 60-90 mins depending on size and water content of strawberries).
3. Watch it closely toward the end of the cooking time because the sugars will be very concentrated and will more easily burn. 

## **Notes**

Cooking time will vary depending upon the water content of the strawberries and the depth of the baking dish. Allow up to 90 minutes for the jam to cook fully. Makes about 2 cups jam per these amounts. Can be stored in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or processed per canning.
