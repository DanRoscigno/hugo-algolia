# Salmon Kebabs with Herb Sauce

`Main Meal` `Kim Acceptable` `Special Meal` `American`

Makes 6 kebabs

**Ingredients:**

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill grates

1 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 pound center-cut salmon, skin and pin bones removed, cut into 24, 1 1/2- to 2-inch cubes

1 small red onion, cut into 1 1/2-inch-wide pieces

1 lemon, sliced into 1/3-inch-thick rounds and then quartered plus lemon wedges for serving

Herb Sauce, recipe follows

_Herb Sauce:_

1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

1 tablespoon lemon zest and 1 tablespoon lemon juice, from 1 lemon

1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

1 clove garlic, smashed and peeled

Kosher salt

1/2 cup packed basil leaves

1/2 cup packed parsley leaves

**Directions:**

Special equipment: Six 8-inch-long metal skewers

1. Preheat the grill to 375 degrees F.

_Kabobs:_

1. Add the olive oil, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the salmon, red onion, and lemon quarters to the bowl and gently toss to coat.
2. To assemble the kebabs, thread a few pieces of red onion onto an 8-inch-long metal skewer (see Cookâ€™s Note). Next, add a piece of salmon, followed by a quarter of lemon. Continue threading the ingredients onto the skewer until you have 4 pieces of salmon on the skewer. Set the finished kebab aside and continue the process with the remaining skewers and ingredients.
3. Generously oil the grates of the preheated grill. Add the salmon kebabs to the grill and cook, turning halfway through, until nice grill marks have formed, and the salmon easily releases from the grill, 4 to 6 minutes. (This can alternatively be done on an indoor grill pan.)
4. Remove the salmon to a serving platter and drizzle with the Herb Sauce. Serve with lemon wedges.

_Herb Sauce:_

**Yield:** Makes about 3/4 cup

1. Add the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a small food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Pulse until the garlic is finely chopped. Add the basil and parsley leaves and blend until finely chopped. Transfer the herb sauce to a bowl to serve with the grilled salmon.
