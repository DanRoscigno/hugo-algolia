For dressing, in a small bowl, whisk together the reserved marinade, salt, and pepper. Slowly whisk in the oil. Drizzle 2 to 3 tablespoons of dressing over warm squash; toss to combine. In a large bowl combine the mixed greens and half of the pistachios. Toss with half the dressing. Gently toss roasted squash into salad. Sprinkle dried apple slices (Fugi) on top.
