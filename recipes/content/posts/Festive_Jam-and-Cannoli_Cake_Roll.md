   Directions  

  # Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease and lightly flour a 15x10x1-inch jelly-roll pan. Stir together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.

# Beat egg yolks and vanilla in a medium mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high speed about 5 minutes or until thick and lemon-color. Gradually add the 1/3 cup sugar, beating on medium speed until sugar is almost dissolved. Fold in melted butter. Wash beaters.

# Beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a large mixing bowl on medium to high speed until soft peaks form (tips curl). Gradually add the 1/2 cup sugar, beating until stiff peaks form (tips stand straight). Fold yolk mixture into whites mixture. Sprinkle flour mixture over egg mixture; fold in gently, just till combined. Spread evenly in prepared pan. Sprinkle with nuts.

# Bake in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until top springs back when lightly touched. Immediately loosen edges of cake; turn out onto towel sprinkled with powdered sugar. Starting with a narrow end, roll up cake and towel together. Cool on wire rack. Unroll cake. Spread jam evenly over cake to within 1 inch of edge. For the cannoli filling in a bowl stir together ricotta cheese, granulated sugar, and vanilla. Stir in bittersweet or semisweet chocolate shavings. Carefully spread Cannoli Filling evenly over jam layer to within 1 inch cake edges. Reroll cake. Cover and chill up to 2 hours.

# To serve, cut cake on the bias into slices with a serrated knife. Transfer slices to individual dessert plates. If desired, sprinkle with chocolate shavings. Makes 10 servings.

# Cannoli Filling: Stir together 1 cup ricotta cheese, 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Stir in 1/3 cup bittersweet or semisweet chocolate shavings.
