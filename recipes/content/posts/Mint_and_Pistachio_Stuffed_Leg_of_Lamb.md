# Mint and Pistachio Stuffed Leg of Lamb

`Main Meal` `Special Meal` `Irish/English/Scottish Inspired`

Serves 6-8

**Ingredients:**

- 2 cups fresh mint leaves 
- 2 cups fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves 
- 1 cup unsalted roasted pistachio nuts 
- 2 garlic cloves 
- 1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
- 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 
- Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper 
- 1 six- to seven-pound leg of lamb, trimmed of excess fat and butterflied (about 2 inches thick) 
- 1 cup homemade or low-sodium canned chicken stock

**Directions:**

- Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place mint, parsley, pistachios, garlic, and lemon juice in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Pulse to combine. With machine running, add 1/2 cup olive oil through the feed tube; process until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
    **Step 1**
- Lay lamb flat on a clean work surface. Spread mint mixture evenly over lamb, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Starting at the narrow end, roll lamb into a tight log; tie well with kitchen twine.
    **Step 2**
- Heat remaining tablespoon olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Place lamb in pan, and cook until browned on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Place in oven; roast until meat thermometer registers 140 degrees when inserted in the center, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Transfer lamb to a platter or cutting board, and let rest 15 minutes.
    **Step 3**
- Meanwhile, make pan sauce: Pour off fat from skillet. Add stock, and deglaze pan by scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Simmer until liquid is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and serve with stuffed lamb.
