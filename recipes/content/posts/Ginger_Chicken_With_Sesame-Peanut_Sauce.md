`Main Meal` `Want to make` `Kim Acceptable` `Asian Inspired` `Island Inspired`

Yield: 4 to 6 servings

**INGREDIENTS:**

_For the Chicken:_

- 1tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 2teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
- 1teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger
- 3garlic cloves, finely grated or minced
- 3½pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and drumsticks
- 1tablespoon grapeseed, safflower or other neutral oil
- 2scallions, thinly sliced, for garnish

_For the Peanut Sauce:_

- ¼cup soy sauce or tamari, plus more to taste
- 2tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar, plus more to taste
- 1small garlic clove, finely grated or minced
- ½teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger
- 1tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1tablespoon honey, plus more to taste
- ½cup smooth peanut butter, preferably natural

**PREPARATION:**

1. Prepare the chicken: In a small bowl, mix together sesame oil, salt, ginger and garlic, and smear mixture all over the chicken and underneath the skin. Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet (or plate), preferably on a rack to allow air to circulate, and refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.
    **Step 1**
2. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Remove the rack under the chicken if you’ve used one. If the chicken isn’t on a rimmed baking sheet, transfer it to one (you can line it with parchment to make clean-up easier, but it’s not necessary). Pat the legs dry with a paper towel. Drizzle chicken with the neutral oil. Roast until the chicken is golden brown and the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pricked with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.
    **Step 2**
3. While chicken is in the oven, make the peanut sauce: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and ginger until combined, then whisk in sesame oil and honey. Add peanut butter and whisk until smooth. If the mixture is very thick (and this depends on your brand of peanut butter), whisk in a few tablespoons of cold water until it becomes a thick but pourable sauce.
    **Step 3**
4. Transfer chicken to a serving plate and carefully pour any pan juices on the baking sheet into the bowl with the peanut sauce. Whisk until combined. Taste the sauce and add more soy sauce, vinegar or honey if you’d like.
    **Step 4**
5. Drizzle or brush some of the peanut sauce all over chicken pieces, reserving some sauce for serving. Garnish with scallions and serve with reserved peanut sauce.
    **Step 5**
