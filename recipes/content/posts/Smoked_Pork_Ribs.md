# Smoked Pork Ribs

`Main Meal` `Picnic Fare` `Summer`

Serves 4

**Ingredients:**

1 rack of pork baby-back ribs

_Rub:_

1 tablespoon garlic salt

2 teaspoons smoked paprika

2 teaspoons toasted and ground coriander seed

Pinch kosher salt

1 tablespoon oregano

2 racks pork baby-back ribs

Juice of 1 lemon

_Glaze:_

1 tablespoon honey

1 tablespoon red wine vinegar

1 garlic clove, minced

1/2 small red onion, minced

Teaspoon fresh oregano

Teaspoon fresh thyme

_Finish:_

1 lemon

Sea salt

1 tablespoon fresh oregano

1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

Drizzle of honey

**Directions:**

1. Mix to combine all the rub ingredients. Moisten the ribs with lemon juice and then coat all sides with the rub, making sure to distribute evenly.
2. Arrange the grill or smoker for indirect heating so the ribs will not be directly over the heat source. Using low heat and applewood chips (about half a pound), place ribs on cool part of the grill, wrap in foil, make a few incisions in the foil and smoke for 1 hour.
3. Meanwhile, whisk together all glaze ingredients.
4. After 1 hour, pour a third of the glaze on top of the ribs and seal tightly in the foil, being careful not to tear it. Do the same with remaining racks. Return ribs to the grill and cook meat-side down for 30 minutes, maintaining low heat. Occasionally check the grill to make sure it remains low. After 30 minutes, flip the foil bundles and continue cooking.
5. After 1 hour of cooking, remove the ribs from the grill and let rest in the foil for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, raise grill heat to medium-high. Cut the lemon in half and grill flesh-side down until nicely marked and slightly soft, 3 to 5 minutes.
6. When done resting, remove the ribs from the foil and place on the grill meat-side down and cook for 4 minutes. Flip and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the ribs from the grill and garnish with the grilled lemon, sea salt, oregano and extra virgin olive oil and a little drizzle of honey.
