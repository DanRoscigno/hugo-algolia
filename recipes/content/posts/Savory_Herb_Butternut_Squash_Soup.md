# Savory Herb Butternut Squash Soup

`Gifts` `Soups` `Thanksgiving` `Fall` `Winter`

**Ingredients:**

_Broth:_

1 quart of good chicken stock 

1 medium onion, quartered

2 whole garlic cloves, peeled

2  celery ribs with leaves (or the middle)

2 whole carrots

Handful of fresh green beans

The backbone of a whole chicken (or corresponding amount of chicken with bones). 

_Soup:_

~1.5 lbs. butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed. ( can intermix with delacata squash too). 

5-6 fresh sage leaves, chopped.

2-3 sprigs of rosemary, leaves removed, and chopped.

1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped.

Salt and pepper

**Directions:**

First, I build a layered chicken and vegetable broth:

Take 1 quart of good chicken stock and add the onion, garlic cloves, celery, carrots, and the chicken. Simmer (Watch that it doesn’t boil) for ~60 minutes, until it is fragrant and veggies are limp. Remove vegetable pieces. This is now your soup broth.

Heat a heavy stock pot with olive oil to medium high. Add the onion and cook until translucent. Add the chopped squash and herbs and stir while they cook. When squash softens, add the broth and turn down to simmer. Cook for 30-40 minutes, until squash is completely cooked. Use an immersion blender to purée. Check seasoning, garnish with more herbs, and serve!
