# Orange Cardamom Ice Cream

`Ice Creams` `Want to make`

Servings: 6-8 servingsÂ  Â  

**Ingredients:**

 â€¢2 tsp. cardamom pods (you can find these sometimes in bulk spice sections, especially at ethnic markets) or 1/4 tsp. ground cardamom

 â€¢1 1/2 cups whole milk

 â€¢1 1/2 cups heavy cream

 â€¢3/4 cup sugar

 â€¢4 oranges

 â€¢6 egg yolks

**Directions:Â  Â  Â**  

 Â  Â  Â  Â  Grind the cardamom pods in a mortar and pestle to remove the pods and slightly break up the peppercorn-like insides.

 

- Combine the milk, 1/2 cup of the cream, the sugar, and the cardamom (pods and interiors) in a medium saucepan. Zest all 4 oranges into this mixture, squeeze in a few teaspoons of juice, and heat over medium heat until it starts to steam. Remove from the heat and let steep, covered, for at least 1 hour (and not more than 2 or 3, but I donâ€™t know why youâ€™d put another hour or two between you and eating this ice cream).

 

- Rewarm the milk mixture. Pour the remaining cream into a large bowl with a mesh strainer on top (or some configuration where youâ€™ll strain the milk mixture into the bowl of cream, to remove the pods and any curds that form in the coming steps).

 

- Whisk together the egg yolks in another bowl that is big enough to hold the eggs and the milk mixture. Slowly pour in the warmed milk mixture, whisking all the time. Pour all of this back in the pan.

 

- Cook the milk/egg mixture to form the custard â€“ over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon so you can leave a trail (the typical making ice cream routine â€“ if youâ€™ve never done it before, consult a cookbook or the internet for more info about this and about how to keep your custard from curdling).

 

- Strain the custard into the cream using the strainer, which will catch the cardamom detritus and extraneous zest (donâ€™t worry, the flavor has seeped into the custard). Stir.

 

- Chill the mixture until not warm â€“ either in an ice bath, in a stopped sink filled shallow with cold water (my preferred method), or just on the counter. Chill overnight or as desired (I did about 7 hours), then make in your ice cream maker per manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Freeze overnight or until desired consistency.
