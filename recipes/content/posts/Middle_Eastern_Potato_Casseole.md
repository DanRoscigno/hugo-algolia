**Ingredients:**

1/4 teaspoon saffron threads

2 lb 4 oz potatoes, cut into large cubes

1 teaspoon olive oil

1 small onion, sliced

1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric

1 cup vegetable stock

**Directions:**

**1.** Put the saffron to soak in 1 tablespoon hot water. Place the potato in a saucepan of cold, salted water. Bring to the boil and cook for 12 minutes, or until tender but still firm. Drain and set aside.

**2.** Heat the oil in a separate saucepan, add the onion, turmeric and ground coriander and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft.

**3.** Add the potato, vegetable stock and garlic. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

**4.** Add the saffron with its soaking water and the raisins, and cook for 10 minutes, or until the potato is soft and the sauce has reduced and thickened. Stir in the parsley and coriander. Delicious with couscous.
