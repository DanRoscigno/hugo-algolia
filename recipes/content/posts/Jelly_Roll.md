# Jelly Roll

`Desserts` `Gifts`

**Ingredients** :

Grease Jelly roll pan. Line with wax paper letting it extend beyond the ends and then grease the paper. Dust the paper lightly with flour.

Sift together twice and set aside:

2/3 cup cake flour, sifted before measuring

1 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch

1/4 tsp salt

3/4 tsp baking powder

In small bowl of mixer, beat at low speed:

4 large eggs

Turn to high and beat until thick and lemon colored, about 3 mins. Return to low speed and add 1 Tbsp at a time:

3/4 cup granulated sugar

Return to high speed and beat full 8 mins. The misture should become light colored and creamy and will almost threaten to overflow the bowl. Return to low speed and gradually add:

1 tsp vanilla extract

Transfer the batter to the large bowl of mixer. Scatter the sifted dry ingredients over the batter. Beat at low speed, constantly scraping sides of bowl, just until the dry ingredients are incorporated. Don't over beat. Pour two strips into pan gently spreading into corners. Bake at 400 degrees for 12-14 mins, or until cake springs back when lightly touched in center. Take care not to over bake. While cake is baking spread kitchen towel on counter. Sift 1/4 cup confectioners sugar back and forth over a cloth, for a generous dusting.

Remove from pan when done. Carefully remove wax paper. Quickly, but gently roll the cake from a narrow end, with the cloth included in the rolling. Leave it rolled, on a wire rack, for about 1 min.

Unroll the cake and spread jelly over cake, stopping short 1/2 inch of the narrow end. Re-roll the cake, without the cloth, working toward the end that is short of jelly and place the seam down on a serving plate. Let it cool completely. Cut a thin slice from each end to remove crispy edges. 

Dust with 2 Tbsp confectioner sugar.

Cut into thin slices. 

Garnish with sprigs of basil, a scoop of sherbert can be served with it.
