# Carrot Ginger Soup

`Soups` `Kim Acceptable`

2 tbsp avocado oil, or olive oil

1 medium onion, diced

3 cloves garlic, minced

3 tbsp ginger, minced or finely diced

2 lbs carrots, peeled and chopped

4 cups vegetable broth

1 bay leaf

1 tsp cinnamon

1 tsp salt

#### **Toppings**

1/4 cup avocado oil

1 shallot

4 tbsp coconut cream

4 tbsp cilantro, chopped

4 tsp pine nuts.

Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large pot. Add the onions and cook for 1-2 minutes or until translucent.

Add the ginger and garlic to the pot and stir for another minute.

Place the chopped carrots in the pot and stir to combine. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring often.

Add the broth, bay leaf, cinnamon and salt to the pot. Bring to a boil, then cover and turn the heat to low for a gentle simmer. Cook for 20-30 minutes or until the carrots are soft when pierced with a fork.

Turn off the heat and remove the bay leaf.

Blend the soup with an immersion blender or transfer the soup to a high-powere blender. Blend the soup until it's pureed and smooth.

To make the crispy shallots, finely slice the shallot and separate each layer of the slice.

Heat the avocado oil in a pan on medium-high heat and once hot, add the shallots.

Cook the shallots for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent one side from browning unevenly. Once the shallots are golden in color remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel.

Divide each portion of soup into a bowl, swirl one tablespoon of coconut cream on top and garnish with crispy shallots, pine nuts and cilantro.
