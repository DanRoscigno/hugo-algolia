1/4 c constarch

1 tsp kosher salt

2 tsp baking powder

1 c unsalted butter, at room temperature

1 1/2 c sugar

4 large egg whites

1/4 c flavorless oil

1 tb clear imitation vanilla (i prefer mccormick brand)

1/2 tsp almond extract

3/4 c whole milk

1/2 c rainbow sprinkles (artificially colored cynlinders, not nonpareils, sanding sugar, or anything naturally colored)

1 3/4 c unsalted butter, at room temperature

3 1/2 c powdered sugar

1/8 tsp kosher salt

1 1/2 tsp clear imitation vanilla

1/4 tsp almond extract

2 tb whole milk 

**Directions:**

_Cake:_

preheat the oven to 350ºf. grease and line the bottoms of three 8-inch cake pans or line 24 cups of two muffin tins.

in a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking powder.

in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. add the egg whites, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. add the oil and the extracts.

with the mixer running on low speed, add the dry mixture and the milk in two or three alternating batches and mix until just barely combined, using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the sprinkles until they're evenly distributed. distribute the batter among the cake pans or muffin cups, spreading it out evenly if using cake pans.

bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. begin checking for doneness at 25 minutes for cakes and 20 minutes for cupcakes.

let cool in the pans for 10 minutes and then turn onto a wire rack to cool completely.

_Frosting:_

in a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter until smooth and gradually beat in the powdered sugar. add the salt, extracts, and milk and beat to combine.

frost the cake or cupcakes as desired and enjoy.
