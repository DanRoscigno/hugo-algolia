`Main Meal` `Want to make` `Winter` `Special Meal` `Italian Inspired`

24-30 servings

**Ingredients:**

_Beef:_

1 whole beef tenderloin, fat trimmed

Olive oil, for drizzling 

2 teaspoons hot Hungarian paprika 

2 teaspoons kosher salt 

Coarsely ground black pepper 

_Pesto:_

1 cup fresh parsley

1/3 cup pecans 

1/4 cup fresh rosemary 

1/4 cup fresh sage 

1/4 cup fresh mint 

2 cloves garlic 

Zest and juice of 1 lemon 

Olive oil, to loosen 

Kosher salt

_Serve:_

Assorted water crackers

Crostini 

**Directions**:

1. For the beef: Drizzle the tenderloin all over with olive oil. In a bowl, combine the paprika and salt. Place plenty of black pepper on a plate. Sprinkle the paprika and salt mixture on the beef, then press the beef into the pepper to coat. Wrap tightly and rest at room temperature for 2 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Unwrap the beef and place on a wire rack set on a baking sheet. Roast until the internal temperature is about 120 degrees F, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove and rest at room temperature or refrigerate.
3. For the pesto: In a food processor, combine the parsley, pecans, rosemary, sage, mint, garlic and lemon zest and juice. Pulse while slowly adding enough olive oil until the desired consistency is reached, like a dip. Taste and season with salt. Refrigerate until needed.
4. To serve: Slice the beef and serve warm or at room temperature alongside the pesto, crackers and crostini.
