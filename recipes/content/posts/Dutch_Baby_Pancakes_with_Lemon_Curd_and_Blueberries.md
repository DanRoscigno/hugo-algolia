# Dutch Baby Pancakes with Lemon Curd and Blueberries

`Want to make` `Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable`

Makes 4

**Ingredients:**

- 3 eggs
- ½ cup flour
- ½ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest1 small lemon
- Pinch kosher salt
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Confectioners sugar optional

_For filling:_

- 1/4 cup lemon curd
- 1/2 pint blueberries

**Instructions:**

- Preheat oven to 425º F (220ºC)
- Add eggs, flour, milk, sugar, vanilla, salt and lemon zest together into a blender and blend until smooth.
- Place butter in heavy skillets (or a single skillet) and place in the oven until butter has melted (just a few minutes, don’t wander off). Pour half the batter into each pan, return them to oven and bake for 20 minutes, until the pancakes are puffed and golden. Lower oven temperature to 300 degrees and bake five minutes longer.
- Remove pancakes from oven, serve individually if using mini skillets, or cut larger Dutch Baby into wedges and top with a dusting of confectioners’ sugar, a spoonful or two of lemon curd and blueberries.
