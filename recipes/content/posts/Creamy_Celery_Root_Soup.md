# Creamy Celery Root Soup

`Soups`

Serves 6

**Ingredients:**

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling

3 ribs celery, chopped 

1 large onion, chopped 

2 medium celery root, peeled and chopped (about 2 1/4 pounds or 4 cups chopped) 

2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 

1 quart low-sodium chicken broth 

1 bay leaf 

1 cup oat milk (or milk or cream)

Chopped chives, for garnish 

**Directions:**

1. Heat the olive oil in a medium Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the celery and onion and cook until they begin to wilt, about 4 minutes. Add the celery root and toss to coat in the oil. Add the thyme and season with 1 teaspoon salt and a generous grinding of black pepper. Cook, stirring, until the celery root beings to wilt, about 4 minutes.
2. Add the chicken broth, bay leaf and 2 cups water. Bring to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Add the oat milk and simmer to incorporate, 3 to 4 minutes.
3. Remove the bay leaf and blend the soup in a blender, in batches, until silky and smooth. Return the soup to the pot to heat through. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve in bowls with a drizzle of olive oil and some chopped chives.
