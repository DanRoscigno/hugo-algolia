# French Onion Soup

`Soups`

 

  Ingredients  

  1/4 cup of butter

3 large onions sliced

Saute onions in butter till transparent. Add 2-3 tsp of sugar and saute a few more minutes. Add 1 Tbsp all purpose flour. Add about 3 cups of home-made beef broth or two 10.5 oz cans of Swanson's beef broth. Add 1 cup of Beaujolais red wine and 1/2 cup of water. Place some stale or toasted french bread sliced in soup bowls and ladle soup over to fill about 3/4 of the way. Add a thick slice of Gruyere cheese to the top and bake at 350 till cheese is melted, golden and bubbly. Best to place the bowls on a baking sheet in case they boil over. Let cool for 10 mins and serve.
