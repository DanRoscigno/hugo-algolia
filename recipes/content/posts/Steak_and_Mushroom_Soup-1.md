# Steak and Mushroom Soup

`Soups`

Steak And Mushroom Soup

hearty; great for crowds and cold days. Author's comment - I think marinating the steak improves its flavor; however, if you are rushed, you might try it without this step.

### **Ingredients**

- 1 ¼ lbs thick shell steak, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes (America’s test kitchen recommends sirloin tip steak (NY strip steak)
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter (or coconut oil)
- 3 medium onions, half coarsely chopped, other half thinly sliced
- 2 small carrots, scraped and finely chopped
- 2 small ribs celery, finely chopped
- 1 lbs fresh button mushrooms, thickly sliced
- Flour for dusting
- 5-6 cups Beef Stock (refer to beef stock recipe on site)
- 1 ½ tsp salt
- Generous 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 large bay leaf
- 1 ¼ lbs escarole, washed and torn into bite-size pieces, with stems broken

#### Marinade:

- 2/3 c safflower oil
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp dark brown sugar
- 2 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 large garlic clove, finely minced

### **Instructions**

1. Whisk marinade ingredients together in a medium bowl and add cubed steak, being sure all is submerged. Set aside for an hour.
2. Meanwhile, heat half the olive oil and butter in a large stockpot. Add the chopped onion, carrot, and celery. Cover over medium to high heat until nicely golden, but not burned, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and continue cooking until they are just wilted, several more minutes. Remove and set aside. Wipe out any lingering bit of vegetable and add the remaining oil and butter.
3. Pat the steak cubes dry and flour them, shaking off excess. Brown in oil and butter over medium heat, being careful not to allow the flour to burn. Remove and set aside. Return cooked vegetables and mushrooms to the pot along with the sliced onions. Add 5 cups beef stock. Bring to a simmer and add salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Simmer for 15 minutes, skimming if necessary.
4. Add steak and simmer for another 10 minutes before adding escarole. You may add more stock here if you think the soup is too thick. Simmer just long enough for escarole to become tender. Do not overcook.
5. Correct seasoning if necessary.
