# Peach Crumb Muffins

`Want to make` `Breads` `American`

![Snapshot.jpg](image/Snapshot.jpg)

**Ingredients:**

3 medium-large(1to 1 1/2) ripe, even very ripe, peaches

1/2 cup (4ounces) unsalted butter, melted

3/4 cup granulated sugar

1 teaspoon, plus a pinch kosher salt

2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided

1 cup plain yogurt, any variety

2 large eggs 2 teaspoons baking powder

1/2 teaspoons baking soda

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

**Ingredients:**

**Heat the oven to 375°F** (190°C). Line twelve standard muffin cups with paper liners, or coat with nonstick spray.

Halve, pit, and thinly slice the peaches. Set twenty-four to thirty-six slices aside for decoration; if the slices are longer than the muffin cups, trim them down. Chop the remaining peach slices into small pieces. You need only 1-1/2 cups; the rest are snacks.

Mix the butter, sugar, a pinch of salt, and half of the flour (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons, or 145 grams) in a large bowl until it forms a clumpy mixture. Remove 6 semi-packed tablespoons (about 115 grams) and set it aside; this will be your crumbs. Add the yogurt and eggs to the big bowl of crumbs, and whisk to combine; it's okay if it doesn't get totally smooth. Add the baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and ginger, and whisk well. Stir in the remaining flour and chopped peaches just until the flour disappears.

Spoon the muffin batter into the prepared cups; it will fill them nearly to

the top. Arrange two or three fanned slices of peach on top of each. Divide

the reserved streusel over the muffins, using it up. Nudge any that spills

off back onto the cups of batter.

**Bake for 20 to 22 minutes**, or until a toothpick inserted under the peach

slices comes out batter-free. Let the muffins rest in the baking tin for

5 minutes before removing. Eat these warm or at room temperature.

**do ahead:** Leftover muffins keep for 2 days at room temperature; I like to keep

them in their baking pan but uncovered. The peach slices on top keep things

moist, but the air keeps the crumbs from getting mushy.

**note:** These also taste great with 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom added. You can use other stone fruit here, too— nectarines, plums, or apricots—

but be sure you have 1-1/2 cups chopped, plus slices for decoration.
