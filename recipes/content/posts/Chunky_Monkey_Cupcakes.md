# Chunky Monkey Cupcakes

`Desserts`

Makes: 12 cupcakes 

**Ingredients:**

_Cupcakes:_

-          2 cups all-purpose flour 
- 1 teaspoon baking powder 
- 1 teaspoon baking soda 
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt 
- 3 ripe bananas 
- 2 tablespoons milk (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract 
- ½ cup butter, softened 
- 1 cup white sugar 
- 2 large eggs 
- 1 cup chopped walnuts 
- 1 cup dark chocolate chunks 

_Dark Chocolate Frosting:_

- 1 cup very hot, but not boiling cream 
- 1 cup dark chocolate chips 
- 12 dried banana chips 

**Directions:**

**Step 1**

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and line a 12-cup muffin tin with liners.

**Step 2**

Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.

**Step 3**

Mash bananas with milk and vanilla extract until smooth.

**Step 4**

Mix butter and sugar together with a spatula until creamy. Whisk in eggs, 1 at a time, then whisk in the banana mixture. Add walnuts, chocolate, and the flour mixture. Mix batter with a spatula until no dry spots remain.

**Step 5**

Fill muffin cups to the top with batter, then distribute excess batter as needed. Tap pan against the counter to expel any air bubbles.

**Step 6**

Bake in the preheated oven until tops are lightly browned, about 25 minutes. Let cupcakes cool to room temperature, at least 20 minutes.

**Step 7**

Pour hot cream over chocolate chips in a bowl. Let sit for a few minutes, then whisk, increasing speed gradually, until color is uniform. Spread ganache over the cooled cupcakes and garnish with banana chips. Refrigerate to firm up the frosting, if desired.
