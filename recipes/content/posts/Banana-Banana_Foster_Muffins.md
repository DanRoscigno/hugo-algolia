# Banana-Banana Foster Muffins

`Breads`

 

  Ingredients  

  Preheat oven to 350 degrees

Topping:

3/4 cup toasted pecans (7 mins)

1/4 cup butter melted

1 cup brown sugar

2 medium bananas cut diagonally

2 Tbsp rum

Batter:

2 cups all-purpose flour

2 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp salt

2 very ripe bananas

1 egg

1/4 vegetable oil

2 Tbsp vanilla

2 Tbsp rum

Toast pecans. Melt butter and add brown sugar. Cook till sugar is dissolved. Add rum. Turn off and add cut bananas. Remove from heat.

Mix wet ingredients for batter with an immersion blender. Mix dry ingredients together. Mix dry ingredients into wet ingredients by hand mixing only enough to incorporate. Spoon topping into bottom of baking tins. Mini bundt pans are best, but you could also use muffin pans and place topping on bottom. Spoon batter over top of topping. Place pan on foil lined cookie sheet pan to catch any escaping drippings. Bake for approximately 25-30 mins, but keep an eye on them.
