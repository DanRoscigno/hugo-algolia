# Salad Nicoise

`Salads` `Want to make` `Kim Acceptable`

Serves 4-6

### **Ingredients:**

1 pound baby red potatoes, whole or halved if bigger than bite-size

1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 

1 pound green beans or haricots verts, trimmed 

1 head Bibb lettuce, leaves separated 

1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, halved 

4 hard-boiled eggs, quartered 

1/2 cup pitted nicoise olives (or your favorite olives!) 

One 8-ounce jar high-quality tuna packed in olive oil, drained 

1/4 cup red or white wine vinegar 

3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 

Freshly ground black pepper 

3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 

Crusty French bread, for serving, optional 

### **Directions:**

1. Add the potatoes to a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Add 1 tablespoon salt and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are almost tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove to a bowl and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Set up a large bowl of ice water and line a sheet tray with a paper towel or kitchen towel. Generously season the boiling water with salt. Add the green beans and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a spider or drain in a colander and transfer to the ice bath. Once cooled, transfer the green beans to the lined sheet tray and pat dry.
3. On a large platter or low bowl, arrange the Bibb lettuce, potatoes, grape tomatoes, green beans, eggs, olives and tuna.
4. Whisk together the vinegar and Dijon with a little salt and pepper in a small bowl or measuring cup. Slowly stream in the oil while whisking until it is all combined and emulsified. Pour about half of the dressing over the salad, reserving the remaining dressing for serving. Serve with crusty French bread, if desired.
