  Ingredients  

  Layer #1:

1/2 butter

4 Tbsp cocoa

1/2 cup 10X sugar

1 well beaten egg

1 tsp vanilla extract

2 cups graham cracker crumbs. Press flat in a 9 X 13 inch pan and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.

Layer #2:

1/2 cup butter

3 Tbsp creme de menth (green)

2 tsp dry vanilla instant pudding

2 cups 10X sugar

Melt butter and add creme de menthe, vanilla pudding and powdered sugar. Beat until smooth. Spread onto first layer and refrigerate 1 hour.

Layer # 3:

1/2 cup butter

2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Melt butter and chips over low heat, stirring constantly. Spread on top of other two layers. Refrigerate until hard. Let soften a little before cutting so they will not chip. Cut in very small pieces as these are very rich!
