# “OMG, These Are Great” Oatmeal Cookies

`Picnic Fare` `Cookies`

Ingredients

1. 1 cup butter, at room temp
2. 3/4 cup brown sugar
3. 3/4 cup white sugar
4. 3 eggs, well beaten
5. 1 Tbsp + 1tsp pure vanilla extract
6. 1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour (can substitute gluten free all purpose flour).
7. 1 tsp salt
8. 1 tsp baking soda
9. 1 tsp cinnamon
10. 1/2 tsp ginger
11. 1/2 tsp nutmeg
12. 1/2 tsp mace
13. 3 cups quick cooking or old-fashioned oatmeal (Not instant)
14. 1 cup golden raisins
15. 1 cup finely chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Cream butter and sugars with your standing mixer using the paddle attachment. In a separate small bowl, whisk the eggs and vanillas together.
3. In a separate bowl combine flour, salt, baking soda and spices. Stir the dry ingredients until well blended. Add dry ingredients to creamed mixture and mix well. When thoroughly blended the mixture will clean the sides of the bowl.
4. Now add in the egg mixture and mix until it loosens back to a batter consistency. Then add the raisins, oatmeal and nuts (if using) and combine well. Form into balls on cookie sheet, leaving room between each for spreading.
5. Bake 8 minutes and spin the tray so that cookies in the front are now facing the back of the oven. Bake an additional 2 to 5 minutes or until golden brown.
6. Let cool on cookie sheet for 2 to 5 minutes or until firm enough to transfer to wire rack. Cool completely on wire racks and store in an airtight container at room temperature.

Notes: Yield: 2-1/2 to 4 dozen cookies (depending on size)
