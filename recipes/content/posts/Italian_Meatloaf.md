- 1 cup finely chopped pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1-1/2 pounds ground meatloaf mix
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- sliced fresh mozzarella cheese (~8ozs)

**Directions:**

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. * Use a fork to lightly mix ingredients. Donâ€™t overmix or meatloaf will be dense. Mix first 10 ingredients and place in a loaf pan. Pour 1 cup of sauce over the top. Place mozzarella slices on the top. Put foil over the loaf-pan. Bake for approximately 70 minutes. Remove foil and let cool for 15 minutes.
