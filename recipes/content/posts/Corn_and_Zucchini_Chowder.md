Serves 6

**Ingredients:**

2 cups corn kernels (frozen or canned fresh)

1 lb zucchini, diced

1 lb potato, peeled and diced

1 cup diced onion

1 cup diced carrot

1 cup diced celery

3 cloves garlic, minced

2 green onions, chopped

1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped

1 teaspoon dried thyme

4 cups chicken broth

2 tablespoons butter

1 cup heavy cream

Salt, to taste

1/4 cup pine nuts (optional, for garnish)

1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional, for garnish)

1/4 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (optional, for garnish)

**Instructions:**

In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the diced onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.

Add the minced garlic to the pot and cook for another minute until fragrant.

Stir in the diced potato, zucchini, corn kernels, chopped basil, and dried thyme. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Pour in the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.

Once the vegetables are cooked, use an immersion blender or transfer a portion of the soup to a blender and puree until smooth. You can leave some chunks of vegetables if you prefer a chunkier texture.

Return the pureed soup to the pot (if necessary) and stir in the heavy cream. Season with salt to taste.

Ladle the corn and zucchini chowder into bowls. If desired, garnish each serving with pine nuts, crumbled feta cheese, and grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.

Serve the chowder hot, with crusty bread or crackers on the side.

Enjoy your delicious and creamy Corn and Zucchini Chowder!
