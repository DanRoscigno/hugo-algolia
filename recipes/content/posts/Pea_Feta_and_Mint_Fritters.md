# Pea, Feta, and Mint Fritters

`Appetizers` `Kim Acceptable` `Summer` `Spring` `Easter` `Mediterranean Inspired`

**Ingredients:**

2 cups frozen peas (10-ounce or 285-gram freezer bag)

3 large eggs, lightly beaten

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1‚ÅÑ4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, or to taste

1 medium lemon

1‚ÅÑ4 cup (15 grams) chopped fresh mint leaves

1cup (4 ounces, or 115 grams) crumbled feta, drained

2‚ÅÑ3 cup (90 grams) all-purpose flour

Olive or neutral oil, for frying

3‚ÅÑ4 cup(175grams) plain Greek-style yogurt

**Directions:**

Defrost the peas: If your peas are still frozen, place them in a colander and rinse them under cold tap water for 1 minute.

Make the fritters: In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with 1‚ÅÑ2 teaspoon salt, lots of freshly ground black pepper, red-pepper flakes, the finely grated zest of your lemon, and mint. Stir in the drained peas and feta, then flour. The batter will be thick.

Over medium-high heat, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil to a large frying pan (nonstick makes it easier here). Once the oil is hot and shiny add two tablespoons (or a heaped small cookie scoop) of the batter, and press gently yo flatten it. Cook until it's deeply golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and repeat until the fritter is golden on the second side. The peas can get a little splattery if they pop, so be careful.

If the fritters are getting dark right away, reduce the heat to medium.¬†

Drain the fritters on a paper towel, and season while hot with a pinch of salt.

Cook the remaining fritters, adding more oil to the pan as needed.

_Make the yogurt sauce:¬_†

Stir together the yogurt, the juice of half the lemon, and several pinches of salt; then taste, adding more salt and lemon if needed, to make a bright, salty sauce.

Dollop the fritters with the lemon-yogurt sauce, and eat while still warm.

Fritters keep well in the fridge for up to 3 days; they freeze well, too. You can defrost and retoast them on a baking sheet in a 350¬∞F (175¬∞C) oven.
