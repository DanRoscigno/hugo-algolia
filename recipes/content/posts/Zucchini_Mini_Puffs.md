3. Make sure you're holding the towel over the sink or a large enough bowl to catch all the water. You don't want a mess.

_How to Prepare the Puffs:_

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and Italian Seasoning.
2. In another bowl, combine the egg with the milk. Then add to the dry ingredients and combine.
