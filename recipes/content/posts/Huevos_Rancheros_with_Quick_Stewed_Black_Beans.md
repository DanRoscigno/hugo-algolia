`Want to make` `Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable` `Mexican/Cuban/Latin Inspired`

Makes 4 servings

**Ingredients:**

_Beans:_

1 tablespoon olive oil

1/2 red onion, finely diced

Kosher salt

3 garlic cloves, finely minced

1/2 teaspoon cumin

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

2 sprigs oregano

1/2 orange

One 540-milliliter/18.25-ounce can black beans, undrained

1/4 cup water (60 milliliters)

_Salsa:_

3 medium ripe tomatoes, such as Roma or vine-ripe, roughly chopped

1/2 red onion, roughly chopped

1/2 to 1 jalapeño pepper, roughly chopped

1/4 cup cilantro, roughly chopped

1 garlic clove, roughly chopped

1 lime, juiced

1 tablespoon olive oil

Kosher salt

_Garnish:_

4 corn tortillas

2 teaspoons olive oil (for frying eggs)

4 eggs

Kosher salt

_Optional toppings:_ crumbled cotija or feta cheese, diced avocado, sour cream, fresh cilantro and/or oregano, sliced jalapeños, lime wedges, hot sauce

**Directions:**

1. For the beans: Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, season with salt and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until softened and beginning to brown. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the cumin, cayenne, oregano, orange, beans with their juices and the water. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, for the salsa: Add the tomatoes, onions, jalapeño, cilantro, garlic, lime juice and oil into the bowl of a food processor. Season with salt and pulse until finely chopped and saucy. Season to taste and set aside. (If your tomatoes weren’t the sweetest, feel free to pour the salsa into a skillet or saucepan and cook over medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes to reduce slightly and sweeten up.)
3. For the garnish: If using a gas stove or if you have access to a grill, turn on the heat and quickly heat the corn tortillas directly over the flame until lightly charred and set aside. You can also heat the tortillas in a pan over medium heat.
4. Heat some oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the eggs and fry until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. Season with salt.
5. To serve, place the tortillas onto plates and top each with black beans and a fried egg. Spoon the salsa overtop and garnish with toppings of your choice.
