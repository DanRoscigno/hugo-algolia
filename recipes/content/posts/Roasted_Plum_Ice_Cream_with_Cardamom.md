# Roasted Plum Ice Cream with Cardamom

`Ice Creams` `Want to make` `Italian Inspired`

**Ingredients:**

6 egg yolksÂ 

2 cups heavy creamÂ 

3/4 cup brown sugarÂ 

1 tsp ground vanilla, 1/2 a vanilla bean (scraped)Â or 2 tsp vanilla extractÂ 

10 cardamom pods, crackedÂ 

2 pounds fresh plums or pluotsÂ 

1/2 tsp ground cardamomÂ 

**Directions:Â** 

_Roasted Plum PurÃ©e:_

Halve your plums, removing the pits, and place them on a baking sheet with the skin side down. Roast at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes, until they're tender and the juices are starting to spill out on to the pan. 

Place the plums into a blender, taking care to scrape up any juices on your baking sheet and add those to the blenderÂ (you don't want to lose that condensed flavor magic!). Add ground cardamomÂ and puree until smooth. 

Place your puree in the fridge to cool.Â 

_Custard:_

Using a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, a hand mixer, or a really super strong arm - whisk together the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar until it doubles in size, lightens to a pale yellow,Â and gains a silky ribbony texture. This should take a fewÂ minutes.Â 

Heat the cream, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, cardamom pods, and ground or bean vanilla (wait until later in the process if you're using the extract) to a scald, which is before a simmer but nice and steamy.Â 

With the mixer running, slowly pour the cream mixture into the yolks until fully combined to temper your eggs. Then pour the mixture back into the pot and heat over medium heat until your custard has formed (if you don't feel comfortable knowing when that is, use a thermometer and look for 180 degrees). While it's heating, use a silicone spatula to gently scrape the bottom of the pan and stir slowly.Â 

When you've reached 180 degrees, strainÂ the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a medium bowl, and set that bowl into a larger one with a bit of ice and water in it to create a cooling water bath. Spin the inner bowl with one hand, whileÂ holding your spatula in the custard like a rudder to help the mixture cool evenly.Â 

Once it has cooled significantly, stir in the plum puree (and the vanilla extract if you're using it) until fully combined and let chill for a few hours.Â 

_Ice Cream:_

Churn based on your machine's instructions.Â I have aÂ [Cuisinart 2 Quart ice cream maker](http://amzn.to/1JAVTm0), and this recipe filled it to the brim. If your machine is smaller, you may want to churn this in two batches, or cut the recipe by a bit!Â
