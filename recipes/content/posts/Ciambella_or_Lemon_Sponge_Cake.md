`Desserts` `Want to make` `Italian Inspired`

### _Ingredients:_

- 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 4 large eggs
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- lemon zest from 2 lemons
- 1/4 cup lemon juice freshly squeezed
- powdered sugar for dusting over the cake

### _Instructions_**_:_**

- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
- Grease a bundt pan and set aside.
- In a small bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder. Set aside.
- In a large bowl beat together the eggs with the sugar on medium high for about 2 minutes or until creamy and pale in colour.
- Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and beat well for another 2 minutes while stopping to scrape down the bowl if using a stand mixer.
- Add in the oil, water, vanilla, lemon zest and juice.
- Beat well until smooth and the batter falls into a ribbon like flow when the beaters are lifted.
- Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan.
- Bake for about 40 to 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown in colour and firm to the touch.
- Alternately, you can insert a toothpick to check for doneness. 
- If the wooden toothpick inserted inside comes out clean, you'll know the cake is done.
- Let the cake cool in the bundt pan for 10 minutes.
- Loosen the edges with an offset spatula or butter knife. Take care not to scratch the non stick finish of your bundt pan.
- Gently invert onto a wire rack to release the cake and allow to cool completely.
- When ready to serve dust with confectioners sugar, slice and enjoy!
