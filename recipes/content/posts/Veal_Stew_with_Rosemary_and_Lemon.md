# Veal Stew with Rosemary and Lemon

`Main Meal` `Special Meal` `Italian Inspired`

Serves: 6

**Ingredients:**

- 3 tablespoons pure olive oil 
- 3 pounds boneless veal shoulder, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces 
- Salt and freshly ground pepper 
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
- 2 celery ribs, finely chopped 
- 1 large onion, finely chopped 
- 1 large carrot, finely chopped 
- 2 cups dry white wine 
- 1 cup tomato sauce 
- 1 tablespoon coarsely chopped rosemary 
- 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley 
- 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 

*serve with _Baked Polenta with Parmesan_

**Directions:**

- In a large enameled cast-iron casserole, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add half of the veal, season with salt and pepper and cook over moderately high heat until browned all over, about 8 minutes. Transfer the veal to a plate. Repeat with another 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the remaining veal. Pour off the oil.
    **Step 1**
- In the casserole, melt the butter in the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the celery, onion and carrot and cook over low heat until softened and golden, about 12 minutes. Add the wine and boil over moderately high heat until almost evaporated, about 12 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, rosemary and veal, along with any accumulated juices. Cover and simmer over low heat, stirring once or twice, until the veal is very tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Stir in the parsley and lemon zest and season with salt and pepper. Spoon the Baked Polenta with Parmesan into bowls, top with the veal stew and serve.
