# Peach, Bourbon and Bacon* Baked Beans

`Side dish`

Makes ~ 6 servings

### **Ingredients:**

3 slices bacon, diced (I have replaced this with 1 package of pork Italian sweet sausage)

1 medium onion, chopped  

Three 15-ounce cans great Northern beans, drained 

1 cup ketchup  

1 cup packed dark brown sugar  

1 cup peach preserves (I used apricot preserves)

3/4 cup chicken broth 

1/4 cup bourbon 

2 teaspoons dry mustard  (I used dry hot mustard)

1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt  

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (I added 1.5 Tbsps)

### **Directions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. In a Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until the fat is rendered, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and reserve. Add the onion to pan and cook until translucent, about 10 minutes.
3. Reduce the heat to low, add the beans, ketchup, sugar, preserves, chicken broth, bourbon, mustard, salt, pepper, garlic powder and reserved bacon and stir until well combined. Bring to a simmer. Cover and bake for 40 minutes. Stir before serving.
