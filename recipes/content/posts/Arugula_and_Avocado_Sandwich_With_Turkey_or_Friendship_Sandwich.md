`Want to make` `Sandwiches` `Picnic Fare` `Thanksgiving` `Kim Acceptable`

Makes 2 Sandwiches

**Ingredients :**

4 thin slices Jewish rye bread, semolina bread or 2 thin and crusty sandwich rolls, split 

1 ripe Hass avocado, pitted, peeled and sliced 

2 ounces thinly sliced roasted turkey 

Fine salt, to taste 

Freshly ground black pepper, to taste 

2 ounces (about 2 large handfuls) arugula, spinach, butter lettuce, Little Gem or a combination 

1 ounce alfalfa sprouts 

1 Persian cucumber, thinly sliced on a bias 

2 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, thinly sliced 

Pickles, for serving (optional) 

Chips, preferably potato, for serving (optional)

**Directions:**

On a cutting board, lay the bread out. Top one slice, or one half of the roll, with a few slices of avocado. 

Top the avocado with half of the turkey and lightly season with salt and pepper. 

Layer on half of the greens, sprouts, cucumber, and lightly season with more salt and pepper. 

Top with slices of cheddar. 

Place another slice of bread atop the cheddar, and press down gently to help secure the bread to the fillings. 

Repeat with remaining ingredients to make the second sandwich. 

Slice each sandwich in half and serve, with pickles and chips on the side, if desired.
