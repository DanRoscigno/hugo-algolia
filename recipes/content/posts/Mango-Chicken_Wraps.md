# Mango-Chicken Wraps

`Picnic Fare` `Main Meal` `Island Inspired`

Makes ~10 wraps

**Ingredients:**

- ⅔ cup vegetable broth 
- ¼ cup chopped cilantro 
- 2 green onions, chopped 
- 1 garlic clove,  crushed
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice (1 lime) 
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 
- ½ teaspoon sea salt 
- 2 fresh mangoes, peeled, chopped, and divided 
- 1 finely chopped and seeded serrano chile pepper (_Wear gloves!_)
- 1 ½ pounds chicken breast **strips** (_Make sure reasonably thin-not pounded but not too thick_)
- ¼ teaspoon salt 
- Arugula 
- 10 (8-inch) flour or corn tortillas 
- Wooden picks (optional)

**Directions:**

- Process first 7 ingredients, 1 chopped mango, and, if desired, chile pepper in food processor until smooth, stopping to scrape down sides. Pour half of mixture into a shallow dish or zip-top plastic freezer bag; add chicken. Cover or seal, and chill **at least** 1 hour (_I did overnight_). Cover, chill, and reserve other half of mango/pepper/cilantro mixture.
    **Step 1**
- Remove chicken from marinade, discarding marinade. Sprinkle chicken evenly with 1/4 tsp. salt.
    **Step 2**
- Grill chicken, covered with grill lid, over medium-high heat (350° to 400°) 4 minutes on each side or until done.
    **Step 3**
- Shred chicken into bite-size pieces. 
    **Step 4**
- Place arugula on each tortilla, and top each evenly with chicken mixture. Add mango mixture on top. Roll up tortillas, and secure with wooden picks, if desired.
    **Step 5**
