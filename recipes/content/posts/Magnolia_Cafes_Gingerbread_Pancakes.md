# Magnolia Cafe's Gingerbread Pancakes

`Breakfasts`

Makes 8-10 large pancakes

### **Ingredients:**

3 eggs

1/4 cup brown sugar

1 cup buttermilk

1/2 cup water

1/4 cup brewed coffee

2 1/2 cups white unbleached flour

1/2 teaspoon baking powder

1/4 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon ground cloves

1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

1 tablespoon ground ginger

1 tablespoon ground nutmeg

4 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted

### **Directions:**

1. In a large bowl, mix eggs and brown sugar until well combined. Add buttermilk, water and brewed coffee, and stir to combine. In another large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Add the liquid ingredients to the flour mixture and stir just until combined. Stir in the melted butter.
2. Grease a griddle or heavy skillet. Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat and then add the batter, by ladlefuls. **Cook until little bubbles appear around the edges of the pancake, and then flip. Cook on the second side until golden brown and cooked through in the middle. Serve immediately.

_**Optional:_ add several banana slices to each pancake, immediately upon placing batter on griddle. Serve with butter and syrup.
