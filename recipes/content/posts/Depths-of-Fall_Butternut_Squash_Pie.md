# Depths-of-Fall Butternut Squash Pie

`Desserts` `Thanksgiving` `Kim Acceptable` `Fall`

Servings: 8Â  Â  Â  

**Ingredients:Â  Â**  

 â—¦1-1/4 pounds (about 2 cups) cubed (1-inch) peeled ready-to-cook butternut squash

 â—¦2 ripe pears, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch cubes

 â—¦1/2 cup moist, plump dried fruit, such as cranberries, raisins (dark or golden) or finely diced apples or pears

 â—¦1/2 cup (packed) light brown sugar

 â—¦1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

 â—¦1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

 â—¦Grated zest of 1/2 orange

 â—¦2 tablespoons fresh orange juice

 â—¦1/3 cup coarsely chopped walnuts

 â—¦2 tablespoons plain dry bread crumbs

 â—¦Sugar, for dusting 

Â  Â  Â  Â  

**Directions:Â  Â  Â**  

Cook the squash in a microwave oven for 6 minutes, or until almost cooked through. (Alternatively, you can steam the squash.) Pat the squash dry and toss it into a large bowl.

 

Add the remaining filling ingredients to the bowl and turn them gently with a large rubber spatula to blend. Let the filling sit for 5 minutes or so, just long enough to give the sugar time to melt, then gently mix again.

 

Remove the pie plate and top crust from the refrigerator and put the pie plate on a baking sheet lined with parchment or a silicone mat. Spoon the filling into the bottom crust and level the top. Brush the rim of the bottom crust with a little water and center the rolled-out crust over the pie - if the top crust is too cold and not pliable, let it sit for a couple of minutes. Using your fingertips, press the top crust gently against the bottom. Either fold the overhang from the top crust under the bottom crust and crimp the crust attractively, or press the top crust against the bottom crust and trim the overhang from both crusts even with the rim of the pie plate. If you've pressed and trimmed the crust, use the tines of a fork to press the two crusts together.

 

Using a small sharp knife, cut 4 slits in the top crust, and cut a circle out of the center of the crust using the wide end of a pastry tip. (If you have time, refrigerate the pie for about 30 minutes. The pie can also be wrapped airtight and frozen for up to 2 months; bake directly from the freezer, adding about 10 minutes to the baking time.)

 

Brush the top of the pie lightly with water and dust with a little sugar. Bake the pie for 55 to 60 minutes, or until it is deeply golden and the filling is bubbling up through the center hole. Check the pie at 40 minutes - if it is already pretty brown, cover it loosely with a foil tent. Transfer the pie to a rack to cool to just warm or to room temperature.

 

**Serving:** This is a go-with-ice-cream pie. Try it with vanilla or cinnamon ice cream.

 

**Storing:** This pie is really best served the day it is made. If you must keep it overnight, store it covered in the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature or warm it for a few minutes in a 350-degree-F oven before serving.
