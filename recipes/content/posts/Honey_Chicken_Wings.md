 ![Honey Chicken Wings](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_CdF_nh1tEpw/SQkmRUzvfNI/AAAAAAAAE1E/tL1Hk_gpU2o/s400/try+out+pix+008-a.JPG)   Ingredients  

  12 pieces of chicken wings

2 cloves of garlic - chopped

1 tsp of chili powder

1/2 tsp of salt

3 tbsp of soy sauce

1/2 tsp of pepper

1 tsp of lemon zest

3 tbsp of honey

1. Clean chicken wings to make sure there are no stray feathers. Cut wings into portions through the joints, discarding wingtips (I left it whole as I like the wingtips).

2. Combine all the rest of the ingredients in a bowl. Add wings and coat in mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 2-3 hours or overnight, stirring occasionally.

3. Preheat oven to 400 degree F. Cover a baking dish with aluminium foil. Spread wings over the base, brush liberally with marinade. Roast for 30-35 minutes until golden brown. Turn the wings half way through the baking. Serve warm or at room temperature.
