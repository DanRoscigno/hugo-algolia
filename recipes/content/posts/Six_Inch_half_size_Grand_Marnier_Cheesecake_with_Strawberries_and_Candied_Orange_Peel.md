***CANDIED ORANGE PEEL**

1 large thick-skinned orange

1/2 cup cold water

2 tablespoons sugar

Using vegetable peeler, cut peel from orange in 1-inch-wide strips. Cut away

any white pith from peel. Cut peel into 3-inch-long 1/8-inch-wide julienne.

Blanch peel in small saucepan of boiling water 1 minute. Drain; rinse peel

under cold water. Repeat blanching and rinsing of orange peel twice.

Cook 1/2 cup water and sugar in heavy small saucepan over low heat, swirling pan occasionally, until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to simmer. Add peel and cook until glaze forms and almost all liquid evaporates,

swirling pan occasionally, about 10 minutes. Transfer peel to waxed

paper-lined plate, separating each piece to prevent sticking. Cool

completely. ( Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and let stand at room
