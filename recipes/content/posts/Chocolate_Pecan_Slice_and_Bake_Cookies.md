# Chocolate Pecan Slice and Bake Cookies

Makes 4 dozen (dough can be frozen up to 3 months)

**Ingredients:**

1 1/4 cups unsalted butter, room temperature (280 grams)

1 cup packed dark brown sugar (200 grams)

1/4 cup granulated sugar (50 grams)

1/2 orange, zested, optional

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 egg white

2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (305 grams)

3/4 cup cocoa powder (67 grams)

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1/4 teaspoon baking soda

100 grams dark or semisweet chocolate bar, finely chopped (about 1 cup)

3/4 cup pecans, roughly chopped (100 grams)

Flaky sea salt, optional

**Directions:**

1. In a large bowl with a hand mixer or the bowl of your stand mixer, cream together the butter, sugars and orange zest, if using, until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and egg white and beat well to combine.
2. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, kosher salt and baking soda. Stir in the chocolate and pecans.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the butter and sugar mixture and stir just until combined.
4. Divide the cookie dough into four equal pieces, roll each into a 15-centimeter (6-inch) log and wrap in plastic wrap. Place the cookie dough in the freezer for at least 4 hours or for up to 2 months.
5. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Slice off as many cookies as youâ€™d like to bake into 1-centimeter (1/2-inch) thick rounds and place on the baking sheet leaving 2 centimeters (1 inch) in between each.
6. Sprinkle the cookies with flaky sea salt, if using, then bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the tops of the cookies are no longer shiny. Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
