# Spicy Pork Loin and Lettuce Wraps

`Appetizers` `Asian Inspired`

Serves 4-6

**Ingredients:**

2 pieces (about 2 pounds) pork tenderloin, trimmed of silver skin

Kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika

2 tablespoons canola oil

3 tablespoons white vinegar

3 tablespoons dark soy sauce

3 tablespoons honey

3 tablespoons fish sauce

3 tablespoons freshly grated ginger, skin on

6 scallions, minced, green and white parts both

36 to 40 medium to large Bibb lettuce leaves

1 small Fresno chili, thinly sliced

12 stems cilantro (about 1/2 cup leaves), stemmed

Directions:

1. Cook the pork: Season the pork all over with the salt, then sift the paprika through a fine mesh sieve over the pork. Heat a cast iron skillet large enough to hold the pork. Add the oil and when it begins to smoke lightly, use a pair of metal tongs to place the pork into the hot oil. Cook over high heat, turning the pork often, browning on all sides, until it reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F in the thickest part of the tenderloin, about 15 minutes total (if you like a little more "done", cook a few minutes longer on each side). Remove the pork and allow it to "rest" on a flat surface. If you like a little more "done", cook a few minutes longer on each side.
2. Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, honey, fish sauce, and ginger. Add the scallions. Taste for seasoning. Set aside.
3. Assemble the wraps: On a large serving platter, arrange "cups" of lettuce leaves, 2 to 3 layers of lettuce per cup. Form the cups with one leaf inside another with the lettuce spines stacked on top of the other.
4. Slice the pork into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Top each lettuce cup with 3 or 4 slices of pork. Season the pork with a little more salt, then top with the chiles. Drizzle the meat with some of the sauce. Top with the cilantro leaves. Top with more sauce if you like.
