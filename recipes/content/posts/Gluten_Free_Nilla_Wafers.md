# Gluten Free "Nilla Wafers" | Nabisco-Style

`Cookies` `Gluten Free`

Makes ~ 36 cookies or pie/cheesecake crust

**Ingredients:**

- 1 ⅓ cups all purpose gluten free flour blend
- ½ teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ⅛ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ cup packed light brown sugar
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature
- 1 large egg at room temperature, beaten
- 4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) milk at room temperature

**Instructions:**

- Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line rimmed baking sheets with unbleached parchment paper and set them aside.
- In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade, add the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and brown sugar.
- Whisk with a separate handheld whisk or pulse to combine. Add the butter, egg, and vanilla, and beat or process until well-combined. Add the milk, and beat or process until the dough clumps.
- Either scoop dough by the level tablespoonful, or pipe an equivalent amount through a pastry bag fitted with a plain piping tip (for more consistent cookie sizing) about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.
- The dough will spread during baking, but not a lot. If you have piped the dough, with wet fingers, gently flatten the top of each raw cookie if anything is sticking up.
- Place the baking sheets in the center of your preheated oven and bake for 15 to 17 minutes, or until the cookies are uniformly golden brown in color.
