# Classic Margarita

`Drinks` `Mexican/Cuban/Latin Inspired`

**Ingredients:**

1 lime wedge

Sea salt, for the glass rim (optional)

2 ounces reposado tequila, preferably a top shelf brand

1 1/2 ounces freshly squeezed lime juice

1 ounce orange-flavored liqueur, such as Grand Marnier

1/2 ounce agave syrup

Ice cubes, for shaking and serving

**Directions:**

###### Special equipment:

a cocktail glass and shaker

1. Make a vertical slice into the lime wedge pulp so that it sits nicely on the rim of a cocktail glass and slide it around the rim to lightly coat it in lime juice. Dip the rim of the glass in sea salt, if using, and tap off any excess. Reserve the lime wedge.
2. Add the tequila, lime juice, Grand Marnier, agave and a handful of ice cubes to a cocktail shaker. Cover and shake vigorously for 15 seconds.
3. Fill the garnished glass with ice cubes (be careful not to get rum salt into drink). Strain the margarita directly into the prepared glass. Garnish with lime wedge.
