`Soups` `Thanksgiving` `Kim Acceptable`

Servings: 8Â  Â  Â  

**Ingredients:Â  Â  Â  Â**  

2 pounds butternut squash, pared, halved, seeded and cubed

4 tart apples, pared, cored, cubed

1 large onion, chopped

2 quarts (or more) chicken broth

fresh pepper to taste

salt to taste

1 Tbsp ground rosemary

1 Tbsp ground marjoram

(optional): 4 eqq yolks and 1/2 cup heavy cream (**I do not use the eggs or cream, so that it is healthier, but then it is technically not a bisque).

Apple slices and sprigs of rosemary for gartnish (optional).

**Directions:Â  Â  Â**  

1) Combine the squash, apples, onion, bread, chicken broth, pepper, rosemary and marjoram in a saucepan. Bring to boiling. 

2) Lower the heat: simmer, uncovered, for 35 minutes, or until the squash and apples are tender. Remove from the heat. Cool to lukewarm.

3) Working in batches, spoon the soup into a electric blender/foodprocesser or use an immersion blender to puree the mixture.

4) (optional): mix the egg yolks and cream in a smal bowl, Beat in a little of the hot soup; return the yolk misture to the aucepan, stirring. Heat gently to serve. Don not boil, or the eggs will curdle.

5) Taste and add salt if necessary.

6) garnish and serve.Â  Â  Â
