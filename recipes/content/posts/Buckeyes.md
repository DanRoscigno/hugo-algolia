# Buckeyes

`Gifts` `Picnic Fare` `Cookies`

###  Ingredients:        

 1 1/2 cups peanut butter

 1 cup butter, softened

 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

 6 cups confectioners' sugar

 4 cups semisweet chocolate chips

        

 **Directions:**

 1. In a large bowl, mix together the peanut butter, butter, vanilla and confectioners' sugar. The dough will look dry. Roll into 1 inch balls and place on a waxed paper-lined cookie sheet.

 2. Press a toothpick into the top of each ball (to be used later as the handle for dipping) and chill in freezer until firm, about 30 minutes.

 3. Melt chocolate chips in a double boiler or in a bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir frequently until smooth.

 4. Dip frozen peanut butter balls in chocolate holding onto the toothpick. Leave a small portion of peanut butter showing at the top to make them look like Buckeyes. Put back on the cookie sheet and refrigerate until serving.

### Servings:  30 cookies
