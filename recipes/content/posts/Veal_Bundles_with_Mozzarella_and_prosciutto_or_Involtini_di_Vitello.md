# Veal Bundles with Mozzarella and prosciutto (Involtini di Vitello)

`Main Meal` `Want to make` `Quick` `Special Meal` `Italian Inspired`

Serves 4

Ingredients:

4 veal scallops

3 ounces mozzarella cheese 

2 ounces sliced prosciutto 

1/2 cup Italian parsley 

1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 

3 Tbsps extra virgin olive oil 

1/2 cup dry white wine 

Directions:

Pound the veal between two sheets of plastic wrap (or inside a bag) until thin. 

Combine mozzarella, prosciutto, and parsley on a board and chop together. Combine in a bowl with the Parmesan cheese and season with salt and pepper. 

Lay the veal flat on a board and divide the mixture between the veal. Roll the veal up, enclosing the filling, and tie securely with the kitchen string. 

Heat the oil in a heavy pan and cook the bundles over moderate heat until golden on all sides. Season lightly, add the wine and cook gently for 10 minutes, until cooked through and the sauce thickens slightly. Transfer to a heated serving plate and keep warm. 

Add a few Tbsps hot water to the pan and over high heat scrape up any browned bits from the bottom and stir until liquid is syrupy. Remove the string from the bundles and drizzle with the sauce.
