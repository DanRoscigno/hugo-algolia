# Lemon And Lavender Madeleines

`Cookies` `Easter`

Makes 12 Madeleines 

### **Ingredients:**

7 tablespoons butter (plus extra for greasing pan)

1 cup caster sugar

2 medium eggs

1 lemon, zested

1 teaspoon lavender (edible)

1 tablespoon honey

2 tablespoons milk

1 7/16 cups plain flour

1 3/8 teaspoons baking powder (about 2 teaspoons)

**Directions:**

1. Melt the butter on a low heat until just starting to darken (use a light coloured pan so you can see the colour change). Remove from the heat as soon as the colour starts to change so it doesn't burn.
2. In a bowl add the sugar and eggs and whisk for 5-10 minutes until pale and you get ribbons. Add the lemon zest, lavender, honey and milk and mix together. Sift in the flour and baking powder and fold with a spatula until just combined.
3. To help the butter mix easily with the mixture, and one tablespoon of batter to the butter and whisk well. Then add the melted butter to the batter and fold to combine. Place the batter in the fridge for about half an hour.
4. While the batter is in the fridge prepare your madeleine pan and set the oven to 350 degrees (fan oven). Brush a little melted butter into each shell, making sure it is completely coated. Take a tablespoon of flour and add a little to each shell. Tilt and shake the pan until each shell is completely covered in a layer of flour. Shake out any excess flour.
5. Place the batter into a large piping bag and snip off about an inch at the bottom. Pipe the mixture into each shell, leaving a little space until the top of the shell. Place in the oven for 5 minutes, turn the oven off for one minute then back on at 350 degrees for a further five minutes.
6. Turn on to a wire rack and sprinkle with icing sugar. These are best served straight from the oven.
