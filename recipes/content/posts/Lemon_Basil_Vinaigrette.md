# Lemon Basil Vinaigrette

`Salad Dressings`

Makes 1 1/2 cups

### **Ingredients :**

- 1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves, washed and dried
- 1 cup lemon juice
- 2 Tablespoon finely chopped shallots
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 2 teaspoons fresh ginger pulp
- ½ teaspoons salt
- 1½ Tablespoons honey
- ¾cup extra virgin olive oil
- freshly ground black pepper

**Directions:**

Prep the basil. If your basil leaves are large, stack a bunch of them on top of each other, roll them up, and then slice the roll to make thin strips. 

In a small mixing bowl or large jar, combine the lemon juice, shallots, garlic, ginger, salt and honey. If you're using a bowl, gradually whisk in the oil, stir in the basil leaves and season to taste with the pepper. If necessary, add more salt. If you're using a jar, add all of the ingredients, put the lid on tightly and shake. If necessary, add more salt.
