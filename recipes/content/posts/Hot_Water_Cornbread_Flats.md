# Hot Water Cornbread Flats

![IMG_0606.JPG](image/IMG_0606.JPG)

Makes 4 

**Ingredients:** 

1 cup of corn meal mix

1 tsp of salt

1 tsp of sugar

3/4 cup of boiling water

**Directions:**

Mix all together and heat any kind of neutral oil to a medium to high heat. I use a regular dinner spoon and scoop two scoops for each one in the skillet and flip each one after about a minute. They come out perfect and so delicious! Enjoy!
