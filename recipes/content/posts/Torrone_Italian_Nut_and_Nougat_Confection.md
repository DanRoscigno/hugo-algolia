# Torrone (Italian Nut and Nougat Confection)

`Want to make` `Gifts` `Candy` `Special Meal` `Italian Inspired`

Serves 40: 80 1” pieces

**Ingredients:**

- 2 (8x10-inch) sheets wafer paper (edible rice paper)
- 3 cups roasted almonds
- 1 cup roasted pistachios
- 1 ⅓ cups honey
- 1 cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 large egg whites, at room temperature
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

**Directions:**

1. Line an 8x11-inch baking dish with plastic wrap, allowing ends to hang over the sides. Place 1 sheet wafer paper in the bottom of the lined dish. Place almonds and pistachios in a warm place to make them easier to mix in at the end.
2. Pour honey into a heavy-bottomed pot. Add 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar; cook over low heat with a spatula, stirring constantly, until mixture turns from grainy to silky and smooth, about 30 minutes. Remove the pot from heat.
3. Place egg whites and salt in a mixing bowl. Whisk until whites form soft peaks, 3 to 4 minutes. Place the pot with honey mixture back on low heat. Gradually whisk 1/4 of the whipped egg whites into honey mixture; whisk in remaining egg whites in 3 more batches.
4. Continue cooking over low heat, stirring constantly with a spatula, until mixture turns a brighter white and a ribbon of mixture on the surface does not immediately incorporate, about 40 minutes. You can add a few drops of mixture to a small bowl of ice cold water to test the consistency; ideally it should feel like soft clay.
5. Whisk in lemon zest and vanilla. Add warm almonds and pistachios; stir to incorporate evenly. Transfer nougat mixture to the prepared baking dish; smooth the top with a clean, oiled spatula. Top nougat with remaining sheet wafer paper, shiny-side up. Lay plastic wrap over the top and press down evenly, tamping mixture down gently but firmly. Remove top plastic wrap.
