# Gluten-free Ebelskivers

`Breakfasts` `Gluten Free`

Makes 18-24 

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup gluten-free flour blend (be sure it includes xantham gum)
- 1.5 tsps sugar
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 large eggs, separated
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 TBSPs unsalted butter, melted... plus extra for greasing your ebelskiver pan
- your favorite jam, laughing cow cheese, deli ham for filling of your choice

**Directions:**

Melt butter gently in your microwave or on the stovetop. Set aside to cool. While butter cools, separate the eggs. Place yolks in a medium-sized bowl and whites in a small pitcher or bowl where you can whip them. Using a hand-held mixer or your strong arm, whip the egg whites until wet peaks begin to form. Set egg whites aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder & salt. Add milk and melted butter to the egg yolks and whisk until combined. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and blend completely.

Before we add the whipped egg whites to the batter, set the ebelskiver pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Brush each ebelskiver well with a bit of melted butter. As the butter heats up, gently fold whipped egg whites into the batter in two additions. Fold delicately until no visible egg whites remain. 

It's time to add the batter to the pan once the butter begins to bubble within the ebelskiver wells. For plain ebelskivers, add approximately 3 TBSPs of batter to each well. If you're making jam-filled ebelskivers, drop about 1 TBSP of batter into each well followed by 1 tsp of your favorite jam and top with another 1 TBSP of batter. If you're making ham & cheese filled ebelskivers, drop about 1 TBSP batter into each well followed by ham & cheese to your taste and top with another 1 TBSP of batter.

**_Quick tip-- fill your ebelskiver wells in the same order every time. Start at the top, work your way around clock-wise, ending with the middle well. This will help each ebelskiver cook evenly... they'll all be in the pan for the same amount of time._**

After 3-5 minutes, use your [ebelskiver tongs](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA39158G6317&ignorebbr=1&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC-_-pla-_-HL+-+Cooking+Utensils+%26+Accessories-_-9SIA39158G6317&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMDTBRDDARIsABX4AWyNheexhMoHe-6kQUbJlYBtbzjifvhVDXIpFY2HsC-1uIZtWGL6usEaAgTBEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), chopsticks or even little forks to flip each ebelskiver in the pan. Cook approximately 3 minutes more, so that both sides of the ebelskiver cook until lightly browned. 

Flip the fully-cooked ebelskivers out onto a plate and eat immediately or keep warm in a 200 degree oven. I think it's best to eat them right away... they will deflate a little bit the longer they sit in the oven.
