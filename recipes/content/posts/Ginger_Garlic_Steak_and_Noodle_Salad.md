`Main Meal` `Summer` `Asian Inspired`

Makes 4-6 servings

**Ingredients:**

_Steak:_

1/4 cup avocado or vegetable oil

1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce

1/4 cup dark brown sugar

2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger

1 tablespoon minced garlic

1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil

1 pound skirt steak

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 lime

_Salad:_

4 ounces udon noodles (see Cook's Note)

1/2 cup avocado oil or vegetable oil

2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce

2 tablespoons rice vinegar

1 tablespoon honey

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

2 teaspoons sesame oil

1 teaspoon grated garlic

1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger

1 teaspoon kosher salt

Juice of 1 1/2 limes

2 cups finely shredded napa cabbage

1 bunch Tuscan kale, stemmed and finely shredded

1 cup carrot ribbons

1 cup whole fresh cilantro leaves

1/2 cup whole fresh mint leaves

4 scallions, thinly sliced

1 Fresno or jalapeño chile, sliced into thin rings

1 cup thinly sliced mango

1/2 cup chopped roasted, salted peanuts

Lime wedges, for serving

**Directions:**

1. For the steak: In a wide, shallow container with a lid, add the avocado or vegetable oil, soy sauce, sugar, ginger, garlic and sesame oil. Whisk to combine. Add the steak and coat in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours. Remove the steak from the refrigerator to come to room temperature before cooking, about 1 hour.
2. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade, pat dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare with an internal temperature of 125 degrees F. Remove from the heat and set aside to rest, about 10 minutes. Squeeze the juice of the lime on the rested steak and slice against the grain.
3. For the salad: Cook the udon noodles according to the package instructions.
4. In a small bowl, combine the avocado or vegetable oil, soy sauce, vinegar, honey, mustard, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, salt and lime juice. Whisk thoroughly to combine and set aside.
5. In a large bowl, combine the cabbage and kale. Add the carrots, cilantro, mint, scallions, chiles and noodles and toss to combine. Add the dressing and toss to coat. Add the mango and gently toss. Sprinkle the salad with the peanuts. Arrange the steak over the salad.
6. Divide the salad and steak among plates. Serve with lime wedges.

### Cook’s Note

Use spaghetti if you can’t find udon noodles.
