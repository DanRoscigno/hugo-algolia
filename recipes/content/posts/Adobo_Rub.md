`Dry Rubs`

Makes ~ 4 servings

**Ingredients:**

- 4 tsp Ancho Chili Powder or any Chili Powder
- 2 Tbsp Lime Juice
- 2 Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1 tsp Cumin
- 1 tsp Onion Powder
- 1 tsp Garlic Powder
- 1 tsp Salt

    **Step 1**

Tips**:**

Make Ahead Tip: Refrigerate for up to 3 days.

Note: Mildly spicy dried chiles, such as ancho or New Mexico, add moderate heat and rich flavor to Mexican sauces like mole. Chili powder made from these chiles has more flavor than American-style blends. Look for it in the specialty-spice section of large supermarkets or online at [penzeys.com](http://penzeys.com).
