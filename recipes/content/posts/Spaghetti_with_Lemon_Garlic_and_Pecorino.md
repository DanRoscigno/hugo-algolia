# Spaghetti with Lemon, Garlic and Pecorino

`Side dish` `Quick` `Italian Inspired`

Makes 4 servings

### **Ingredients:**

Two 8-ounce pieces Pecorino-Romano, such as Locatelli

1 head garlic, broken down into cloves and peeled 

Kosher salt 

1 pound spaghetti 

1/2 stick unsalted butter 

1/4 teaspoon red chile flakes 

3 tablespoons lemon juice 

2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley 

2 cups baby arugula 

Extra-virgin olive oil, for finishing 

One 4-ounce piece burrata 

### **Directions:**

1. Add the Pecorino-Romano pieces to a medium saucepan and cover with water (about 2 cups). Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, add the garlic cloves to a small saucepan and add just enough water to cover. Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn off the heat and strain. Add the garlic cloves back to the same saucepan and repeat the process 2 more times. (This will bring out the natural sweetness of the garlic.) Allow to cool to the touch, then carefully shave very thinly on a mandoline.
3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook to very al dente according to the package directions.
4. Meanwhile, add the butter to a large saute pan and turn the heat on medium-high. Once the butter begins to melt, add the garlic and chile flakes. Let the butter melt and the garlic to fully bloom in the butter, about 1 minute. Strain the cheese stock directly into the saute pan, then stir and allow to come to a simmer. Add the cooked pasta and lemon juice to the sauce and finish cooking the pasta in the sauce. Add the chopped parsley and toss to combine.
5. Pour the pasta into a serving bowl and top with the arugula, then drizzle with olive oil and salt to taste. Top with the burrata. Gently open the burrata just a touch, then serve immediately.
