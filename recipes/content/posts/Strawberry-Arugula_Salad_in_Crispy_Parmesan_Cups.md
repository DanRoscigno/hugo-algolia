# Strawberry-Arugula Salad in Crispy Parmesan Cups

`Want to make` `Appetizers` `Side dish` `Summer` `Spring` `Italian Inspired`

Serves 6

**Ingredients:**

Nonstick cooking spray

2 cups freshly shredded Parmesan

2 tablespoons honey 

2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 

2 tablespoons minced shallot (from 1 large) 

1 large clove garlic, minced 

1/4 cup olive oil 

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 

1 (5-ounce) package baby arugula 

1 cup sliced fresh strawberries 

1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 

1/4 cup sliced green onions 

1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans 

**Directions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with a silicone mat. Turn a muffin tin upside down and coat the bottoms with nonstick cooking spray. Form 3 (1/3-cup) mounds of Parmesan cheese on the silicone mat and pat out each to a 5-inch circle. Bake until the cheese melts and is browned and bubbly, 5 to 6 minutes. Working with one circle at a time, quickly lift each round of cheese to the muffin tin, gently pressing the edges to create a dome. Repeat the process with the remaining cheese. Set aside to cool.
2. Whisk together the honey, vinegar, shallot and garlic in a small bowl. Gradually add the olive oil and whisk until combined. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Toss together the arugula, strawberries, parsley, green onions and pecans in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. To serve, place the Parmesan cups onto serving plates and divide the salad evenly among them.
