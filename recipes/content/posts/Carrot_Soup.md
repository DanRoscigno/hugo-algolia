# Carrot Soup

`Soups` `Kim Acceptable`

6 ServingsÂ  Â  Â  

**Ingredients:Â  Â  Â**  

1 pound of carrots

2 cups of chicken broth

2 Tbsp butter

2 Tbsp flour

1/2 tsp salt

1/8 tsp cayenne pepper (or more to taste)

_Optional:_ 1 cup half n half ((I like it better without this)

**Directions:**

Peel carrots and rinse under cold water. Cut into 1/2 inch slices. Put carrot slices into a pot and add chicken broth. Cook over medium-high heat. When it begins to boil, turn down to medium-low. Cover pot. Cook for 20 minutes or until they are very soft and break apart when pierced with a fork. Melt the butter in a separate saucepan and add flour. Cook the rue for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Puree carrot/broth mixture with immersion blender or by taking batches of the carrot/broth out and placing in a blender or food processor. Slowly add rue to pureed carrot mixture. Turn up the heat to medium high and cook for 10 minutes. Stir often. Add in cayenne pepper and salt to taste. Add half n half at this point if you wish. Do not let it boil if you've added half n half. Ladle into soup bowls and serve with crackers.Â  Â  Â
