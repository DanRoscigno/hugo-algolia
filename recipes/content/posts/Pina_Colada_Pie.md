# Pina Colada Pie

`Desserts` `Want to make` `Island Inspired`

Serves 6-8

**Ingredients:**

_Crust:_

Nonstick cooking spray, for the pie plate

15 toasted coconut shortbread cookies (see recipe)

1/2 cup toasted pecans 

1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut 

4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature

1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 

_Fresh Pineapple Layer:_

1 1/2 cups finely diced or grated fresh pineapple

1/2 cup granulated sugar 

2 tablespoons cornstarch 

Juice of 1 lime 

_Creamy Coconut Layer:_

One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature

3/4 cup sweetened coconut cream 

2 teaspoons lime zest 

1 teaspoon rum extract 

2 large eggs 

_Topping:_

2 cups heavy cream

1/4 cup confectioners' sugar 

1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut

**Directions:**

1. For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch pie plate with nonstick cooking spray.
2. In the bowl of a food processor, grind the cookies and pecans into a fine crumb. Add the coconut, butter and salt and pulse a few more times to combine. Dump the mixture into the prepared pie plate and press the mixture evenly up the sides and along the bottom. Bake until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack until slightly cooled. Leave the oven on.
3. For the fresh pineapple layer: Add the pineapple and granulated sugar to a saucepan. In a small bowl, stir together the cornstarch and lime juice, then add the mixture to the saucepan with the pineapple. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking until combined. Continue cooking and whisking until the mixture starts to thicken, about a minute. Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool slightly.
4. For the creamy coconut layer: In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until very smooth. Add the coconut cream, zest and rum extract and beat until combined and smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time.
5. Spread the pineapple mixture into the cooled crust. Pour the cream cheese mixture on top of the pineapple mixture. Bake until the filling is set, 40 to 50 minutes. Tent the edges of the crust with aluminum foil if the crust gets too dark. Remove to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight.
6. For the topping: When ready to serve, whip together the heavy cream and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl to soft peaks. Spread the topping onto the chilled pie. Decorate the top of the pie with the coconut.
