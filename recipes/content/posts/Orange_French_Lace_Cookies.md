# Orange French Lace Cookies

`Want to make` `Cookies`

Makes ~ 36 cookies

**Ingredients:**

2 cups blanched sliced almonds

1 cup all-purpose flour 

1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter 

2/3 cup light brown sugar, lightly packed 

1/3 cup light corn syrup 

2 tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate, defrosted 

2 teaspoons grated orange zest 

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 

**Directions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper.
2. Place the almonds on a sheet pan and toast them for 5 to 10 minutes, until lightly browned, tossing once to toast evenly. Place 1 cup of the toasted almonds in a food processor fitted with the steel blade and chop them very coarsely. (Reserve the rest for later.) Combine the chopped almonds with the flour and set aside.
3. Meanwhile, place the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, orange juice concentrate, orange zest, and vanilla in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Off the heat, gradually whisk in the flour mixture until thoroughly combined. Stir in the reserved toasted almonds.
4. With 2 teaspoons (tableware rather than measuring spoons), drop rounded spoonfuls of batter (about 1 1/2 inches wide) onto the prepared sheet pans, spacing them at least 2 inches apart. (I put 8 on each pan.) Bake for 7 to 9 minutes, until the edges are golden brown, turning the pans in the oven to brown evenly. Allow to cool and transfer to a wire rack. Repeat for the remaining batter. Store the cooled cookies in an airtight container between layers of wax or parchment paper.
