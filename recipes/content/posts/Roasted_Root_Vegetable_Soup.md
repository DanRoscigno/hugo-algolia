# Roasted Root Vegetable Soup

`Soups` `Thanksgiving` `Kim Acceptable`

 

  Ingredients  

  1 Medium to Large Rutabaga

3 Small to Medium Sweet Potatoes

1 Medium Red Onion

1 Large Yellow Onion

2 Large Parsnips

4 Medium to Large Carrots

1 Medium to Large Butternut Squash

1 Small to Medium Celery Root

Peel, seed, and cut into relatively equal sized chunks. Place in a

roasting pan or on a cookie sheet. Cover generously with olive oil and

salt and pepper. Toss to cover evenly. Try to spread out so all get

roasted evenly. Roast at 325 degrees till tender (will depend on size of

vegs. and how spread out they are). Place in a large pot and add 2 quarts

of a good quality chicken (or turkey) or vegetable stock, rosemary, thyme,

parsley, and sage to taste. Cook approximately 30-45 mins more. Puree

mixture with an immersion blender or by placing parts of it in a blender

or food processor. Serve with a salad and rustic bread. Enjoy!

Note: This recipe is very flexible. Use other vegetables that you have and

throw them in as well. I make it somewhat different each time I make it

depending on what I have already in my refrigerator.
