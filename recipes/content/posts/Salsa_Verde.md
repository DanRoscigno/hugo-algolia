**INGREDIENTS:**

6 large tomatillos, husks removed, rinsed

6 chiles poblano, halved, seeded, and stemmed

3 chiles jalapeño, halved, seeded, and stemmed

1/4 medium onion

4 scallions, trimmed

3 unpeeled garlic cloves

3 sprigs oregano

1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds

2 tablespoons extra virgin

**Directions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 475°F. Toss the tomatillos, poblanos, jalapeños, onion, scallions, garlic, oregano, coriander, and cumin with the oil and 1 teaspoon salt on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until the vegetables are soft and browned, 20 to 30 minutes. Let cool slightly.

2. Peel the garlic cloves and discard the husks. Strip the oregano leaves from the stems and discard the stems. Transfer the tomatillo mixture along with any accumulated juices on the baking sheet and the garlic and oregano leaves to a blender and purée until smooth. Season with more salt if necessary.
