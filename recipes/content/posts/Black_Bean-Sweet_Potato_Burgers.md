Ingredient Checklist

- ½ cup old-fashioned rolled oats

    ½ cup chopped scallions
    ¼ cup vegan mayonnaise
    1 tablespoon no-salt-added tomato paste
    1 teaspoon curry powder
    ⅛ teaspoon salt
    1/2 cup plain unsweetened almond milk yogurt
    2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill

    2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
    4 whole-wheat hamburger buns, toasted
    1 cup thinly sliced cucumber
    2 cups grated sweet potato

**Directions**

Instructions Checklist

**Step 1**

Squeeze grated sweet potato with paper towels to remove excess moisture; place in a large bowl. Pulse oats in a food processor until finely ground; add to the bowl with the sweet potatoes. Add beans, scallions, mayonnaise, tomato paste, curry powder and salt to the bowl; mash the mixture together with your hands. Shape into four 1/2-inch-thick patties. Place the patties on a plate; refrigerate for 30 minutes.

**Step 2**

Stir yogurt, dill and lemon juice together in a small bowl; set aside.

**Step 3**

Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the patties; cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.

**Step 4**

Divide the yogurt sauce evenly among top and bottom bun halves. Top each bottom bun half with a burger and cucumber slices; replace top bun halves.

**Tips**

To make ahead: Prepare patties (Step 1); wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days.
