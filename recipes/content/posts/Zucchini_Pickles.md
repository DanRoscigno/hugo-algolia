# Zucchini Pickles

`Condiments` `Camping`

Makes 2 pint jars or one quart jar

### **INGREDIENTS:**

- 1 pound zucchini (about 3 medium or 2 large)
- 1 medium yellow or white onion 
- 1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds
- 1/2 to 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1/2 bunch fresh dill
- 1 cup distilled white vinegar*
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar

### **INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Trim the ends and very thinly slice 1 pound zucchini crosswise (about 5 cups). (If you prefer thicker zucchini with more bite, slice to 1/8-inch thickness.) Thinly slice 1 medium yellow or white onion until you have 1 1/2 cups. Place the onion and zucchini in a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 2 hours to allow the zucchini and onion to dry out. 
2. Drain the vegetables and pat dry with paper towels. Pack into a clean 1-quart jar or 2 pint-size jars. 
3. Coarsely chop 1/2 bunch fresh dill until you have 1/4 cup. Place the dill, 1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds, and 1/2 to 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes if desired on top of the vegetables, dividing them between the two jars if needed.
4. Bring 1 cup distilled white vinegar, 1/2 cup water, and 1/4 cup granulated sugar to a boil over high heat in a small saucepan. Boil until the sugar is dissolved. Pour into the jar(s), leaving 1/2-inch space on top. Use a metal straw, chopstick, or thin utensil to push the veggies around to release any big air pockets and make sure they are submerged in the brine. Carefully cover with lids and let cool at room temperature for 1 hour. Serve immediately or refrigerate and enjoy for up to 1 week.

### **RECIPE NOTES**

**Safe pickling: ***Safe storaging of any pickled products require use of vinegar that has at least 5 % acidity. Many vinegars are only 4%, so check the vinegar you are using!

**Storing:** Pickled zucchini can be refrigerated in the jar(s) for up to 1 week.
