# Mushroom, Asparagus and Pea Risotto

`Want to make` `Side dish` `Kim Acceptable`

### Makes ~ 6 servings

### **Ingredients:**

6 to 8 cups chicken stock

5 tablespoons olive oil 

2 pounds mixed cremini and shiitake mushrooms, sliced 

3 small shallots or 1 large shallot, finely diced 

1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces 

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 

2 cups arborio rice 

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 cup white wine 

1 cup arugula leaves

1 cup frozen peas, defrosted 

1/4 cup heavy cream 

3 tablespoons grated Parmesan

2 tablespoons salted butter 

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 

5 fresh mint leaves, torn 

### **Directions:**

1. In a medium stockpot, add the chicken stock and heat until warm.
2. In a large stockpot set over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Saute the mushrooms, shallots and asparagus until softened, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, 1 more minute. Add the arborio rice and a pinch of salt. Saute for 2 minutes. Then add the wine and cook until the liquid is absorbed, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the stock 1 cup at a time and cook, stirring after each addition, until all of the liquid is absorbed. Season periodically with salt and pepper to taste. (This process takes about 30 minutes of cooking and constant stirring.)
3. Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the arugula, peas, cream, Parmesan, butter and lemon juice. Top with the mint and serve.
