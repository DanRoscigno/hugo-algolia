# Lemon-Toasted Poppy Seed Cake

`Desserts` `Gifts`

Serves 8-10

**Ingredients:**

_Cake:_

1/3 cup poppy seeds

12 Tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 

Grated zest of 1 lemon

1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt

1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 

1 tsp baking powder

1 tsp baking soda

1/2 tsp salt

1 cup granulated sugar

2 large eggs

_Syrup:_

2/3 cup fresh lemon juice

2/3 cup granulated sugar

**Directions:**

_Cake:_

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat 9‚Äù round cake pan with cooking spray. Line the bottom with parchment paper. (_I put mine in a pampered chef loaf pan and did not grease or use parchment paper_).

In a small skillet, toast poppy seeds over low heat for 3 minutes, or until fragrant. Add the butter and heat until melted. Stir in the lemon zest. Let cool to room temperature. Whisk in yogurt. 

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. 

In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the sugar and eggs until light in color. Alternately beat in flour mixture and butter mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. 

Scrape the batter into the pan and bake for 1 hour, or until the cake starts to pull away from the sides of the pan and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with some moist crumbs attached. 

Run a knife around the sides of the pan to loosen cake and invert it on a rack. Pull off paper, if you used. Place it right side up on a plate. Poke several holes in top. Spoon 1/2 mixture over top. Let stand until syrup has been absorbed, then spoon the remaining over top. Serve warm or at room temperature. 

_Syrup:_ in a small saucepan, combine the lemon juice and sugar and cook over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved.
