Makes 24 cups

**Ingredients:**

1 cup creamy peanut butter

1 cup light brown sugar, packed

1 large egg

1 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Raspberry jam (or your favorite flavor)

**Directions:**

Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) and prepare a mini muffin tin with liners or non-stick spray.

In a bowl, mix peanut butter and brown sugar until well combined.

Add the egg, baking soda, and vanilla extract, mixing until a dough forms.

Roll the dough into small balls and place in each muffin tin well.

Press a thumbprint into the center of each dough ball and fill with a teaspoon of jam.

Bake for 8-10 minutes until the edges are golden. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
