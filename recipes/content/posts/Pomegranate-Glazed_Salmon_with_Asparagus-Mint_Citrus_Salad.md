# Pomegranate-Glazed Salmon with Asparagus-Mint Citrus Salad

`Main Meal` `Kim Acceptable` `Special Meal` `American`

Makes 4 servings

### **Ingredients:**

1 pound asparagus

1 orange

2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 

1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 

1 cup frozen lima beans, defrosted 

1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts, crushed 

1/4 cup fresh mint, minced 

2 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced 

2 scallions, thinly sliced on the bias up to the pale greens

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Four 3- to 5-ounce skin-on salmon fillets, thoroughly dried with a paper towel 

Pomegranate Glaze, recipe follows

###### Pomegranate Glaze:

1/2 cup pomegranate juice

2 tablespoons honey 

2 tablespoons brown sugar 

2 tablespoons Dijon mustard

1 teaspoon cornstarch 

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### **Directions:**

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil; prepare an ice water bath. Blanch the asparagus in the boiling water, then transfer to the ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain, then cut the asparagus spears on the bias into thirds.
2. Zest the orange, remove and discard the peel and cut the flesh into segments; squeeze the juice from the remaining membranes into a large bowl.
3. Add the vinegar, mustard and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the bowl with the orange juice; whisk together. Add the orange zest and segments, asparagus, lima beans, hazelnuts, mint, parsley and scallions and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Position an oven rack in the second position from the top and preheat the oven to broil.
5. Heat a nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Season all sides of the salmon with salt and pepper. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil to the skillet. Place the salmon fillets in the skillet skin-side down and cook for 1 minute.
6. Set aside some of the Pomegranate Glaze in a separate bowl for serving, then brush the salmon liberally with the remaining glaze, being careful not to let too much drip down as the glaze will burn and hinder the crisping of the skin. Transfer to the oven and broil until the glaze is caramelized and the internal temperature of the salmon reaches 125 degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes.
7. Serve over the asparagus salad with a couple smears of the reserved glaze on the side.

#### Pomegranate Glaze:

1. Whisk together the pomegranate juice, honey, sugar, mustard, cornstarch and some salt and pepper in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Let cool.
