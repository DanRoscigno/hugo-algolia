**Ingredients:Â  Â**  

1/4 cup olive oil

12 oz. zucchini, cut into 1/4 inch slices

8 oz. mushrooms

1 large red onion, thinly sliced

1 yellow bell pepper, seeded, thinly sliced

1 red bell pepper, seeded, thinly sliced

1 green bell pepper, seeded, thinly sliced

**Note:** On 5/13/23 I made 1 bag of sautÃ©ed spinach that is squeezed, with 1-small grey squash, 1-zucchini, 1-yellow squash, asparagus, 1- yellow pepper, 1-red pepper, 1-leek, 1- purple onion, 4 garlic cloves, thyme, salt/pepper, 4 cups gluten freeÂ  baguette and bread, eggs and a little more whipping cream, baby Bella mushrooms, GruyÃ¨re cheese instead of Swiss and a hard goat cheese grated on top. It was awesome!
