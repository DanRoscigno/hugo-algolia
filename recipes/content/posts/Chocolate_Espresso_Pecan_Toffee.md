# Chocolate Espresso Pecan Toffee

`Want to make` `Gifts` `Candy`

Serves 12

**Ingredients:**

- 1 1/4 (2 1/2 sticks) cups unsalted butter
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
- 1 tablespoon molasses
- 1 teaspoon flaky salt (I used fleur de sel)
- 1/3 cup water
- 2 cups chopped toasted pecans
- 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips (semi-sweet or dark)

**Instructions:**

1. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the granulated sugar, light brown sugar, espresso powder, molasses, salt, and water. Cook, stirring constantly until a candy thermometer reaches the hard crack stage (300ÂºF), about 20 to 25 minutes.
2. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the pecans. Pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle with the chocolate and let stand for a minute or two until softened. Using a spatula, smooth the chocolate over the toffee. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until firm. Break the toffee into shards. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 weeks.
