# Steak and Garlic Noodles

`Main Meal` `Want to make` `Quick` `Asian Inspired`

Serves 2

**Ingredients:**

_Steak:_

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced

8 to 10 ounces cooked rare rib eye steak, at room temperature, cut into 1/2-inch-thick strips

_Sauce:_

1/4 cup granulated sugar

1/4 cup oyster sauce

1/4 cup chopped red onion

8 cloves garlic, minced

1 1/2 cups beef stock

2 tablespoon rice wine vinegar

8 to 10 ounces Asian noodles, cooked according to their package

2 scallions, thinly sliced on the bias

**Directions:**

1. For the steak: In a large pan with straight sides on medium heat, add the oil, bell pepper and steak. Cook the steak to warm up and to the desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the peppers and steak to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan.
2. For the sauce: In the same pan, add the sugar and cook until the mix has a deep brown color and begins to smoke, about 30 seconds. Quickly add the oyster sauce, onion, garlic, beef stock and vinegar. Cook until slightly thickened, about 8 minutes.
3. Add the noodles and move them around to coat. Serve with the steak, peppers and scallions over the top.
