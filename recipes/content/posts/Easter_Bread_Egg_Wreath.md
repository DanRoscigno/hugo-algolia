# Easter Bread Egg Wreath

`Breads` `Spring` `Easter`

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup milk, at room temperature
- 1 package dry active yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour 

_Dough_

- ¼ cup currants 
- ¾ cup golden raisins 
- 1 cup dried cranberries or dried cherries
- ¼ cup diced dried apricots or dried mango
- 1 tablespoon rum
- 2 eggs plus 3 egg yolks
- 12 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks), melted, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 teaspoon fine salt
- ½ cup sugar 
- 2 teaspoons anise seeds
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1 teaspoon grated orange zest
- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- ¾ cup slivered almonds
- 1 tablespoon milk
- Sugar or pearl sugar for topping, optional

**Directions:**

1. Make the sponge: Put 1 cup milk in a medium bowl, add yeast and let dissolve. Whisk in 1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour. Cover bowl and leave in a warm place until doubled in size and very frothy, about 30 minutes.
2. Put currants, raisins, cranberries and apricots in a small bowl and cover with hot water. Leave 10 minutes, then drain. Return to bowl and stir in rum.
3. Beat 2 eggs and 2 of the yolks. Add the beaten eggs, melted butter and almond extract to sponge and stir together. Stir in dried fruit.
4. In a large bowl mix together 4 cups (500 grams) all-purpose flour, salt, sugar, anise seeds, cardamom, orange zest, lemon zest and almonds. Pour sponge mixture over flour mixture and combine, stirring with a spoon or hands until it forms a shaggy, slightly sticky mass. Dust lightly with flour and turn dough out onto a clean work surface. Knead for a few minutes until smooth, dusting with a minimal amount of flour if necessary, to make a soft dough. (If desired, dough may be refrigerated overnight in a large zippered storage bag. Bring to room temperature and proceed with recipe.)
5. Put dough in a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Punch down dough and knead lightly. Divide dough in half with knife and form two loaves; they can be round, braided or free-form. Place side by side on a large parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving a 4-inch space between them (or use 2 smaller baking sheets). Cover lightly with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place a rack in the middle of the oven, and heat oven to 350 degrees.
6. Make the egg wash: with a fork, beat together the remaining egg yolk and the milk. Uncover loaves and brush generously with egg wash. Sprinkle each loaf with 2 tablespoons sugar (or 1 tablespoon pearl sugar), if desired. Bake on middle rack for 45 minutes or until loaves are a dark, glossy brown. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.
7. To make wreath: Braid dough and form into a round wreath. Brush with egg wash. Place decorated eggs around wreath and cook as instructed.
