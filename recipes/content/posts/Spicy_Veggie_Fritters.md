### Method:

1. Pick the florets off the broccoli, finely chop the florets into small pieces. Note: don't throw out the stem of the broccoli. You can use it to make a soup!
2. Deseed the red pepper and red chilli, and finely chop both into small pieces. Then finely chop the spring onion and cilantro. Mince the garlic. 
3. Add all the chopped veg to a mixing bowl along with the remaining ingredients and 4-5 tablespoons of water. Stir until fully combined. Try adding more water if the fritters aren't holding together.
4. Heat a little oil in a frying pan on a low-medium heat. While the oil heats up, divide the mixture into 8 and shape each eight into a round fritter. Add 2-3 fritters to the frying pan at a time, cover the pan with a lid and fry for 5-8 minutes on each side or until golden brown. It's important to cook the fritters for long enough so the chickpea flour cooks in the middle. Repeat until all of the fritters have been used up, adding more oil to the frying pan as you go so the fritters donâ€™t stick to the pan. 
5. Roughly chop the mint and stir it into a few tablespoons of vegan yoghurt.
6. Serve the fritters alongside the sweet chilli sauce and mint yoghurt.
