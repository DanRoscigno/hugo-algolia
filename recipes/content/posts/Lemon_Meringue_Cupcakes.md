# Lemon Meringue Cupcakes

`Desserts`

Makes 12

**Ingredients:**

Lemon Curd:

- ⅔ cup lemon juice 
- 3 large eggs 
- 5 tablespoons white sugar 
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest 
- 3 ½ tablespoons salted butter, cut into small pieces 

Cupcakes:

- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour 
- ¾ cup white sugar 
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder 
- ½ teaspoon salt 
- ½ cup milk 
- ¼ cup vegetable oil 
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract 
- 1 large egg 
- ½ cup hot water 

Meringue:

- ½ cup white sugar 
- 3 large egg whites 
- ¾ teaspoon lemon juice 

**Directions:**

**Step 1**

Combine lemon juice, eggs, sugar, and lemon zest for lemon curd in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a spatula or spoon, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain through a sieve into a bowl. Stir in butter until melted; set aside.

**Step 2**

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.

**Step 3**

Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt for cupcakes into a large bowl. Pour milk, oil, vanilla extract, and egg onto the dry mixture. Mix thoroughly with an electric mixer of by hand. Pour in hot water and mix to combine; batter will be thin. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin liners, filling about 3/4 full.

**Step 4**

Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.

**Step 5**

Core each cupcake using either a corer or a knife. Spoon in lemon curd.

**Step 6**

Pour sugar and egg whites into a large bowl. Place the bowl over a saucepan or pot of simmering water. Whisk constantly until sugar is dissolved and egg whites are warm, to between 120 and 140 degrees F (49 to 60 degrees C) on a thermometer, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat.

**Step 7**

Mix in lemon juice and whip at high speed until stiff peaks form. Pipe meringue onto the cupcakes.

**Step 8**

Set an oven rack about 10 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.

**Step 9**

Place cupcakes under the preheated broiler until meringue has browned, about 2 minutes.
