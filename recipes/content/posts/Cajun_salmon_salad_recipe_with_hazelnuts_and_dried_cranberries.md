`Salads` `Main Meal` `Picnic Fare` `American`

**Ingredients:**

_Dry Rub*:_

1 teaspoon paprika

3/4 teaspoon sea salt

3/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1/4 teaspoon onion powder

1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1/8 teaspoon dried thyme

1/8 teaspoon oregano

_Salad:_

2 tablespoons oil

8 oz-skinless salmon fillet

1 tablespoon lemon juice

1/4 cup chopped celery

1/2 cup chopped carrots, divided

1/2 cup dried cranberries, divided

2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard

2 tablespoons honey

1/2 teaspoon Cajun spice rub (reserved above)

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/4 cup lemon juice

1/4 cup vegetable oil

1/2 large head red or green leaf lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces (enough to make 6 cups)

2 cups mixed baby salad greens

**Directions:Â  Â  Â  Â**  

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

Prepare the Cajun salmon: In a small bowl, stir together the paprika, salt, garlic and onion powders, black pepper, cayenne, thyme, and oregano. Set aside 1/2 teaspoon of the spice mixture for the salad dressing. Sprinkle the remaining spice mixture on both sides of the salmon fillet and rub into the flesh. Heat the oil in a small skillet large enough to hold the salmon fillet. Sear the fillet in the hot oil, about 2 minutes on each side. Cover the skillet and place in preheated oven for 8 minutes to finish cooking the fish. Remove fish from oven and transfer to a plate. Drizzle salmon with lemon juice and place in the refrigerator to cool.

Prepare the salmon salad and dressing: When cold, flake the salmon. In a medium bowl, toss together the flaked salmon, celery, 1/4 cup carrots, and 1/4 cup cranberries. Whisk together until well blended the mustard, honey, spices, salt, lemon juice, and oil. Set aside 3 tablespoons of the dressing for the greens. Pour the remaining dressing over the salmon mixture and toss until well combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Prepare the salad greens and assemble the salad: Wash the greens and spin dry. Place in a large bowl, cover with (paper or cloth) towels and place in the refrigerator to crisp (30 minutes to several hours). When ready to serve, toss the greens with the 3 tablespoons of dressing. Divide dressed greens among 4 serving bowls or plates. Top greens with a scoop of salmon salad. Sprinkle each salad with the three whole hazelnut and one tablespoon each carrots and cranberries.Â  Â  Â Â
