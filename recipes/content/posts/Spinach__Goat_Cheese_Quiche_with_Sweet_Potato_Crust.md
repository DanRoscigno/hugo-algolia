### Instructions:

- Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 9 inch pie pan with nonstick cooking spray. Add sweet potato slices all around the base (as the photo shows in the picture above). Cut some in half if you need them to fit on the sides. Spray the sweet potatoes with additional nonstick cooking spray. Bake for 20 minutes. Once done, remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Keep heat in oven.
- While sweet potato crust is baking, cook the veggies: Add olive oil to a medium skillet and place over medium high heat. Add in onion and diced tomato; saute for a few minutes. Then add spinach and saute for another minute, or until spinach wilts. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
- In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, almondmilk, salt and pepper.
- Add spinach mixture over the baked sweet potato crust, then pour egg mixture over the top. Sprinkle goat cheese crumbles on top along with an additional sprinkle of salt and pepper.
- Bake for 30-45 minutes or until egg sets and puffs up. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes before cutting into 6 slices. Quiche should be stored covered in the fridge for 5-7 days.
