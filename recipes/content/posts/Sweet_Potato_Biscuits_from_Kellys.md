# Sweet Potato Biscuits from Kelly's

`Breakfasts` `Breads`

 

  Ingredients  

  1 lb. cooked sweet potatoes (steamed or boiled)

1 c. light brown sugar

1/4 c. water

2 1/4 c. Bisquick (or any biscuit mix)

Cool and peel sweet potatoes. Mix together sweet potatoes, brown sugar, Bisquick mix and water. Combine ingredients thoroughly. (The mixture will be moister than regular biscuits.) Flour table. Roll biscuit mix to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with 1 (2 1/2 inch) cutter. Placed on greased sheet pan.

Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees for 16-18 minutes. (The moist mixture does not allow the biscuits to rise a great deal. A mindful eye should be kept on the biscuits so they do not overcook.)  

   Servings  

  1.5 dozen
