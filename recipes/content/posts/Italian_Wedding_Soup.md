# Italian Wedding Soup

`Soups` `Kim Acceptable` `Italian Inspired`

Servings: 8     

  

**Ingredients:**         

_For the meatballs: (see comment below)_

3/4 pound ground chicken

1/2 pound turkey sausage, casings removed

2/3 cup fresh white or Panko bread crumbs

2 teaspoons minced garlic (2 cloves)

3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

1/4 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano

1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus extra for serving

 3 tablespoons milk

 1 extra-large egg, lightly beaten

 Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

_For the soup:_

 2 tablespoons good olive oil

 1 cup minced yellow onion

 1 cup diced carrots (3 carrots), cut into 1/4 inch pieces

 3/4 cup diced celery (2 stalks), cut into 1/4 inch pieces

 10 cups homemade chicken stock

 1/2 cup dry white wine

 1 cup small pasta such as tubetini or stars

 1/4 cup minced fresh dill

 12 ounces baby spinach, washed and trimmed

**Directions:**

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

_For the meatballs_: 

place the ground chicken, turkey sausage, bread crumbs, garlic, parsley, Pecorino, Parmesan, milk, egg, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl and combine gently with a fork. 

With a teaspoon, drop 1 to 1 1/4-inch meatballs onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. (You should have about 40 meatballs. They don't have to be perfectly round.) 

Bake for 30 minutes, until cooked throughly and lightly browned. Set aside.

_Soup:_ 

Heat the olive oil over medium-low heat in a large heavy-bottomed soup pot. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and saute until softened, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Add the chicken stock and wine and bring to a boil. 

Add the pasta to the simmering broth and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until the pasta is tender. 

Add the fresh dill and then the meatballs to the soup and simmer for 1 minute. Taste for salt and pepper. 

Stir in the fresh spinach and cook for 1 minute, until the spinach is just wilted. Ladle into soup bowls and sprinkle each serving with extra grated Parmesan.

         I double the meatball recipe so that it is a heartier meal, but you do not have to. by CeceliaJoos-Roscigno, Sun, Jan 3, 2010 at 12:42 CST
