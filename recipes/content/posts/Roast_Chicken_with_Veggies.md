`Main Meal` `Want to make` `Kim Acceptable` `Irish/English/Scottish Inspired`

Makes ~ 4 servings

**Ingredients:**

1 whole chicken (about 1 3/4 kilograms/3 3/4 pounds)

5 garlic cloves, skin on, divided

1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley

1 teaspoon finely chopped woody herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, sage, and/or savory

3 tablespoons (42 grams) unsalted butter, room temperature, divided

Kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

1 lemon

1 large red onion

6 to 8 sprigs of rosemary, thyme, sage, and/or savory, divided

1/2 buttercup squash, cut into wedges

3 large carrots, cut into 5-centimeter (about 2-inch) pieces

1/2 small cauliflower, cut into medium-sized florets

1/2 bulb fennel (one whole if itâ€™s small), root removed and cut into wedges

4 medium yellow potatoes

3 tablespoons olive oil, divided

2 1/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided

1/4 cup dry white wine, optional

2 tablespoons flour

**Directions:**

1. Set your oven rack to the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Pat the inside and outside of the chicken dry with paper towel.
2. Peel and finely mince one clove of garlic and add it to a small bowl along with the chopped herbs. Mash in 1 tablespoon of butter and season with salt and pepper.
3. Gently separate the chicken skin from the breast meat using a spoon and divide the garlic herb butter under the skin of each breast, smoothing it to an even layer. Season the inside and outside of the chicken well with salt and pepper.
4. Cut the lemon in half, peel and slice the onion into eight wedges through the root, and smash and peel one garlic clove. Stuff the lemon and garlic into the cavity of the chicken along with one wedge of onion and two sprigs of herbs. Tie the legs together with a piece of kitchen twine and tuck the wings underneath the bird, then set the chicken aside at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes.
5. Transfer the remaining onion, garlic and herb sprigs to a roasting pan along with the roughly chopped vegetables. Quarter the potatoes and add it along with 2 1/2 tablespoons of oil to the pan. Season well with salt and pepper and toss to coat.
6. Shake into an even layer and place the chicken on top of the vegetables. Drizzle the remaining oil over the chicken and rub it in to coat. Pour 1/4 cup of chicken broth and the white wine over the vegetables.
7. Roast the chicken, uncovered, for 60 to 75 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees F and the vegetables are tender.
8. Remove the chicken and the vegetables to a serving platter and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm and rest while you make the gravy.
9. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat in the roasting pan. Add the flour, whisk, and cook for 1 minute. While whisking, slowly add in the remaining 2 cups of chicken broth. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the gravy reaches your desired consistency. Serve alongside the chicken and roasted vegetables.
