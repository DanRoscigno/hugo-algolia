# Tahini Cinnamon Sweet Potatoes with Toasted Meringue

`Side dish` `Fall`

Makes 8 servings

**Ingredients:**

5 sweet potatoes (about 12 ounce or 340 grams each)

2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more to taste 

Freshly ground black pepper 

1/4 cup (60 grams) tahini 

3 tablespoons (45 grams) pure maple syrup 

2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature 

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 

1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 

2 large egg whites, at room temperature 

1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 

1/3 cup (110 grams) light corn syrup 

1/3 cup (40 grams) confectioners' sugar 

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 

**Directions:**

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Poke the sweet potatoes a few times each with a fork. Place on a baking sheet and bake until tender all the way through, about 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool just until you can handle them.
2. Split the sweet potatoes lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl, leaving a shell of sweet potato flesh about 1/4 -inch thick. Discard 2 shells so you have 8 all together. Season the inside of the 8 with 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper and place back on the baking sheet.
3. To the sweet potatoes in the bowl, add the tahini, maple syrup, butter, 1 teaspoon salt, cinnamon and ginger. Mash with a fork or masher until smooth. Spoon back into the shells and bake until the sides are crisped and browned, about 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, to make the meringue, whisk the egg whites in a stand mixer on medium speed until foamy, about 30 seconds. Add the cream of tartar, and beat to combine. Add the corn syrup, confectioner’s sugar, vanilla and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Whisk on medium high speed until stiff peaks form, scraping the bowl down with a spatula once or twice as you go, about 2 minutes.
5. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag fitted with a piping tip of your choice (such as a large open star tip, large or medium round) and decorate the potato with the meringue. Alternatively, you can spoon a heaping dollop on top. Toast with a kitchen blow torch (or broil) to desired brownness. Serve immediately.
