# Pork & Cider Stew with Cheese & Herb Dumplings

`Main Meal` `American`

**INGREDIENTS:**

FOR THE STEW:

- 2 ½ lbs pork shoulder (cut into 1-inch cubes)
- 1 white onion (thinly sliced)
- 3 cloves garlic (minced)
- 2 large carrots (diced)
- 2 sticks celery (diced)
- 1 x 12oz can chopped tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- ½ cup hard cider (optional – if you don’t use it, increase the stock amount accordingly)
- 1 ½ cups beef stock
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- ¼ cup Italian parsley (chopped)
- Olive oil for sautéing
- Kosher salt
- Ground black pepper

FOR THE DUMPLINGS:

- 2 cups ap flour
- 1 stick unsalted butter (cold & cubed)
- ½ stick unsalted butter (melted for glaze)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup grated cheese (I used cheddar)
- 1 teaspoon rosemary (finely chopped)
- 1 teaspoon sage (finely chopped)
- 1 teaspoon Italian parsley (finely chopped)
- 1 teaspoon thyme (finely chopped)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper

### DIRECTIONS:

1. Add two tablespoons olive oil to a large oven proof baking dish (I used a cast iron skillet) and bring to a medium heat.
2. Sear off the cubed pork shoulder until each side has a even brown color.
3. Remove the pork and keep to one side
4. Add two more tablespoons of oil to the pan and bring to a medium heat.
5. Add the onions.
6. Season with salt and pepper and cook gently until the onions are soft and golden.
7. Add the garlic and cook gently for two minutes
8. Add the carrots and celery and sauté two to three minutes.
9. Add the tomato paste and combine
10. Cook for two minutes.
11. Add the oregano and combine.
12. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for two minutes.
13. Add the pork cubes.
14. Add the cider, the beef stock and the Worcestershire sauce.
15. Combine well and place a lid on the pot.
16. Simmer on a low heat for sixty minutes.
17. Remove the lid and simmer for another thirty minutes.
18. By this time, the pork cubes should be tender and the sauce should have reduced by half. If you want a thicker stew, you can mix a little cornstarch and water and whisk in to thicken the sauce more.
19. Check for seasoning and add more salt and/or pepper to taste
20. Add the chopped parsley.

### FOR THE DUMPLINGS:

1. While the stew is simmering after the lid has been removed you can make the dumplings.
2. Place the flour in a mixing bowl.
3. Add in the salt, pepper, baking powder and chopped herbs.
4. Combine well.
5. Add in the grated cheese and combine well.
6. Add in the cold cubed butter.
7. With your hands, rub the flour mixture and butter together until the end result resembles breadcrumbs.
8. Slowly add the water, a bit at a time, and combine until the mixture is a very sticky dough.

### TO FINISH:

1. Using a spoon, place drops of dough a little bigger than a golf ball around the top of the pan of stew.
2. Pre-heat an oven to 350 degrees.
3. Cook the dumplings for around 20 minutes.
4. At the 10 minutes stage, brush the dumplings with the melted butter and sprinkle with a little salt.
5. Top with more chopped parsley before serving.
6. Serve with mashed potatoes, crunchy bread or plain steamed rice.
