# Couscous Salad with Pistachios and Dates

`Want to make` `Side dish` `Kim Acceptable` `Gluten Free` `Middle Eastern/Moroccan Inspired` `Mediterranean Inspired`

Serves 6-8

**Ingredients:**

6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided

1 1/2 cups (230 grams) pearl/Israeli couscous

2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided

1 large lemon, halved

2 teaspoons coriander seeds, coarsely cracked

1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper flakes, plus more for sprinkling

2 Persian cucumbers (175 grams), diced

1 cup (60 grams) chopped, roasted pistachios

1 cup (125 grams) chopped Medjool dates

1 cup (112 grams) crumbled feta

3 cups (50 grams) packed, chopped Swiss chard

1 cup (14 grams) packed fresh Italian parsley leaves

1 cup (12 grams) packed fresh cilantro leaves

3 scallions, trimmed and halved

1/2 cup (6 grams) fresh mint leaves

**Directions:**

1. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the couscous. Cook and stir until lightly toasted, 2 to 4 minutes. Add 2 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer. Cover and cook until the water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Transfer to a serving bowl and let cool while you make the rest of the salad.
2. Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add the lemon cut-side down. Cook until charred on the underside, about 1 minute. Remove the lemon and wipe the skillet clean. Return the skillet to medium heat. Add the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil. Add the coriander and Aleppo and cook until sizzling, about 30 seconds. Stir in the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Squeeze the lemon juice into the pan and whisk to emulsify. Pour over the couscous, add the cucumbers, pistachios, dates and feta and toss to combine.
3. Put the chard, parsley, cilantro, scallions and mint in a food processor and pulse to chop finely (but not pasty). Add to the serving bowl. Toss very well to combine. Sprinkle with a little Aleppo and serve.
4. Store leftover salad in a covered container in the refrigerator and use within 2 days.
