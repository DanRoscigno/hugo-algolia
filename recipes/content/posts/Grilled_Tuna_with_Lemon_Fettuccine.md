  Ingredients  

  1 4oz. piece of Parmesan cheese cut into 2 inch pieces

1 large garlic clove

1/3 cup plus 1 Tbsp olive oil

1 1/4 pounds 1 inch-thick fresh tuna fillets

salt and fresh ground pepper

1 medium red onion, cut into 1/4 inch dice

2 medium tomatoes peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/2 inch dice

1/2 to 1 cup chicken stock

Heat remaining garlic oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, stirring frequently, about 4 mins. Mix in tomatoes, 3/4 cup stock, lemon juice and lemon zest. Bring to simmer. Add fettuccine and cook until just warmed through. Gently mix in tuna and spinach and warm through. Add remaining 1/4 cup of stock if thinner sauce is desired. Remove from heat and serve immediately over pasta. Serve with lemon wedges.
