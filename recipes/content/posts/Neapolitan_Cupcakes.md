# Neapolitan Cupcakes

`Desserts` `Kid’s Delight`

**INGREDIENTS**

1/2 vanilla cake recipe 

1/2 dark chocolate cake recipe 

**STRAWBERRY BUTTERCREAM**

1/2 c. chopped strawberries

8 oz. cream cheese, softened to room temperature

1/4 c. butter, softened 

3 1/2 c. powdered sugar

1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract

Red food coloring (optional)

**DIRECTIONS**

1. Preheat oven to 350° and line two muffin pans with cupcake liners. Make cake recipes according to instructions. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of chocolate batter into bottom of each cupcake liner. Fill rest of the cup with vanilla batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted into middle of a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Let cupcakes cool completely. Repeat with the remaining better.
2. Make frosting: Add strawberries to a food processor and blend until strawberries are mashed and almost completely pureed. In a large bowl, combine cream cheese and butter and beat with a hand mixer until smooth. Gradually add powdered sugar and beat until fluffy. Add vanilla and strawberry puree and mix until evenly incorporated. Stir in food coloring, if desired, for a pinker color. 
3. Frost cupcakes with strawberry frosting.
