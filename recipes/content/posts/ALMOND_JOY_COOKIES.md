# ALMOND JOY COOKIES

**Ingredients:**

1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened

1/4 cup granulated sugar

1/4 cup packed brown sugar

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 small egg

1/2 cup all-purpose flour

1/4 teaspoon baking soda

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut

1/4 cup chocolate chips

1/4 cup chopped almonds

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat and Prepare: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Cream and Combine: In a mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add in the vanilla extract and the small egg. Mix well until combined.

3. Mix the Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined.

4. Fold in the Goodies: Gently fold in the sweetened shredded coconut, chocolate chips, and chopped almonds. This will create the delightful texture and flavors of Almond Joy.

5. Scoop and Shape: Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop small portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Shape the dough portions into round cookies, flattening slightly.

6. Bake to Perfection: Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them to prevent over-baking.

7. Cool and Enjoy: Once baked, let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
