# The Best Gluten-Free Banana Cake Ever!

`Desserts` `Gluten Free`

### Serves 8

### **INGREDIENTS:**

- 2 ripe bananas - mashed
- 1/2 c butter - at room temp
- 2 eggs
- ¾ of a cup of brown sugar
- 1½ cups of gluten free **self raising** flour - I use Orgran Gluten Free Self Raising Flour
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- ¼ teaspoon of baking soda
- ¼ cup of milk (of your choice) I use almond milk

### **INSTRUCTIONS:**

- Preheat oven to a moderate temperature 180ºC or 350ºF
- Cream butter, sugar and vanilla together
- Beat in eggs, one at a time
- Mash bananas well with a fork then beat into the creamed mixture
- Fold in flour and soda, then stir in milk
- Line a cake tin (or ring tin) with baking paper. (I line the base and cut off the extra paper and grease the sides with butter)
- Spoon onto the baking tin and bake at 180ºC or 350ºF (moderate oven) for 45 mins or until cooked. Test with a skewer and if it comes out clean, then it is ready.
- Cool in the tin for a few minutes before turning out onto a cake cooler.
- You can serve it warm drizzled with custard or when the cake is cool, ice it with your favorite icing.
