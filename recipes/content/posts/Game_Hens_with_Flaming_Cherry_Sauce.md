**Directions:**

Rinse and pat hens dry. Sprinkle inside cavities with seasoned salt & pepper. Place breast side up, slightly apart, in roasting pan. Combine butter & seasonings; brush over hens, using it all. 

Bake in 350* oven, uncovered, for about 1 hr or until leg joints move easily. During last half hour, baste birds several times with the drippings. 

Meanwhile, prepare cherry sauce and keep warm 

over low heat. 

_Cherry Sauce:_

Drain syrup from cherries & reserve. Combine 1/3 C of reserved syrup with water, bouillon cube, onion, cloves, & cinnamon in pan. Bring to boil, stirring, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 10 min. Strain, discarding cloves and onion. Return sauce to pan. Stir water/cornstarch slurry into sauce and cook, stirring, until it boils & thickens. Stir in cherries, lemon peel, & juice. Set aside & keep warm. When hens are roasted, discard excess fat from their pan juices and then stir juices into the cherry sauce. 

_Presentation:_

Arrange hens on serving plates and garnish 

with orange slices; keep warm. To flame birds, warm brandy in a small container; ignite (not under an exhaust fan or flammable objects) and pour, flaming, into sauce. While still flaming, spoon sauce over birds.
