## **How to Make Pasta Chips**

If you are pressed for time, then just about any type of hearty chip or thinly sliced crusty bread will work with this dip. But what really takes this snack to the next level is when you make your own homemade pasta chips. And don’t worry, it is not as hard as you think.

Most home cooks are intimidated when it comes to deep-fat frying. As long as you follow a few simple guidelines, it is simple, and there is nothing to stress about.

1. Cook the lasagna noodlesaccording to the package instructions. Save the no-boil lasagna noodles for a different dish, they won’t work in this recipe.
2. Use a paper towel to pat dry the noodles thoroughly. Any water left on the noodles will cause the hot oil to sizzle and splash.
3. Heat the vegetable oil in a heavy-bottom pan like a Dutch oven. While the oil is coming to temperature, cut cooked noodles into chip-sized portions.
4. Use a thermometer to check the oil is at 360 degrees.
5. Gently place two sheets worthof cut pasta into the hot oil. Fry in batches for a minute on each side until golden brown and bubbly. Remove and place on a **[wire rack](https://copykat.com/recommends/bakers-secret-1061483-10-by-16-inch-nonstick-cooling-rack-set-of-2/ "Baker's Secret 1061483 10-by-16-Inch Nonstick Cooling Rack, Set of 2")**. Pat dry and season with garlic salt.
