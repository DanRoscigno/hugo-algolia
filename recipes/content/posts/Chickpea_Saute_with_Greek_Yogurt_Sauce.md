  Ingredients  

  For the saut√©:

1 tsp. cumin seeds

2 Tbs. olive oil

4 carrots, peeled and diced

1 red onion, chopped

1 garlic clove, minced

250g freshly cooked chickpeas (or 1 x 400g can, drained)

100g baby spinach, rinsed

1 Tbs. finely chopped coriander

1 Tbs. finely chopped parsley

1 Tbs. lemon juice

For the sauce:

100g Greek yogurt

1 Tbs. olive oil

1 Tbs. lemon juice

1 tsp. finely chopped coriander

1 tsp. finely chopped parsley

Directions:

1. First, make the sauce. Mix together all ingredients in a small bowl, salt and pepper to taste, and set aside.

2. Heat a large pan over medium-high heat add the cumin seeds. Toast for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant and beginning to colour. Add the olive oil and carrots and cook, stirring frequently, for 5-6 minutes. The carrots should begin to become tender and get some colour.

3. Add the onion and garlic and cook for another 5 minutes or so until soft and translucent. Add the chickpeas and cook for 2-3 minutes until hot through. Add the spinach, herbs and lemon juice and cook for just enough time for the spinach to wilt. Remove from heat, season to taste and serve with the yogurt sauce on the side.
