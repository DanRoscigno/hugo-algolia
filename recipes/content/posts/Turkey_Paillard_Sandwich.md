# Turkey Paillard Sandwich

`Main Meal` `Sandwiches` `Italian Inspired`

 

  Ingredients  

  * 1/2 boneless turkey breast (1 3/4 pounds)

 * Basic Marinade (see below)

 * 1 sweet onion, such as Vidalia, cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds

 * 5 plum tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds

 * 2 25-inch baguettes, halved lengthwise

 * 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

 * Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper

 * 2 ounces Parmesan cheese, sliced paper-thin

 * 1 cup fresh basil leaves

 

Directions

 1. Remove tenderloin from turkey; cut tender in half lengthwise. Cut breast into 3/4-inch-thick medallions. Cut open two sides of a resealable plastic bag. Place 1 medallion in bag; pound to a 1/4-inch thickness with a meat pounder. Transfer to a nonmetal container. Repeat with remaining turkey. Add marinade. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 hours.

 2. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium hot. Brush onion, tomatoes, and bread with oil. Season onion and tomatoes with salt and pepper. Grill onion until browned and soft, about 2 minutes per side. Set aside on a plate. Grill tomatoes without turning until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Grill bread until just toasted, 1 to 2 minutes.

 3. Remove turkey from marinade; season with salt and pepper. Grill until browned and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Layer bread with onions, turkey, Parmesan, basil, and tomatoes, and top with remaining bread. Serve.

Basic Marinade:

 * 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil

 * 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, crushed

 * 2 sprigs fresh thyme

 * 3 large cloves garlic, smashed

 * Juice of 1 lemon

 * 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
