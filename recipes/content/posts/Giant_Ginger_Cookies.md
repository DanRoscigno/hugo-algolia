# Giant Ginger Cookies

`Cookies`

 

  Ingredients  

  4 teaspoons ground ginger

1-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon salt

2 cups granulated sugar

1/2 cup molasses

4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking soda

1 teaspoon ground cloves

1-1/2 cups shortening

2 eggs

3/4 cup coarse sugar or granulated sugar

  

   Directions  

  In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt; set aside.

2. In a large mixing bowl beat shortening with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds to soften. Gradually add the 2 cups granulated sugar. Beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally. Beat in eggs and molasses. Beat in as much of the flour mixture as you can with the mixer. Using a wooden spoon, stir in any remaining flour mixture.

3. Shape dough into 2-inch balls using 1/4 cup dough. Roll balls in the 3/4 cup coarse or granulated sugar. Place about 2-1/2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.

4. Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 12 to 14 minutes or until cookies are light brown and puffed. (Do not overbake or cookies will not be chewy.) Cool on cookie sheet for 2 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool. Store in a tightly covered container at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Makes twenty-five (25) 4-inch cookies.
