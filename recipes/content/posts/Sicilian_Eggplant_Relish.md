# Sicilian Eggplant Relish

`Picnic Fare` `Condiments` `Appetizers` `Kim Acceptable` `Gluten Free` `Italian Inspired`

Makes 5-6 cups (_might want to half this recipe_)

**Ingredients:**

6 Tbsp olive oil, preferably EV

2 lbs. small or medium eggplants, peeled, if desired, and cut into 1 “ cubes

2 cups chopped yellow onion

1 cup chopped fennel or celery

1 cup chopped red sweet pepper

1-2 minced garlic

1 28 oz can peeled, seeded, drained, and chopped canned tomatoes (I used fire roasted)

1/4 cup red wine vinegar

2 Tbsp white sugar

1/2 -1 tsp of salt

1/4-1/2 tsp black pepper

1/4 cup well drained capers

6-8 Sicilian-style green olives, pitted and cut into quarters

1/4 cup pine nuts

1/2 cup fresh basil

**Directions:**

Heat 4 Tbsp of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add eggplant and sauté until soft and browned, about 10 minutes. Remove to a bowl and set aside. 

Add the remaining 2 Tbsps olive oil to the same pan and place over medium high heat. Add the onion, fennel or celery, and sweet pepper and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for about 1 minute longer. Add the tomato, vinegar, browned eggplant, and sugar, salt, and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes. 

Stir in capers and olives and continue to simmer until the eggplant is tender, about 15 minutes. Taste and add more vinegar and/or sugar, salt, and pepper. Stir in the nuts and basil and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature before serving, or cool, cover, and **refrigerate for as long as 2 weeks**. 

**Note:** can preserve longer by ladling the hot mixture into sterilized jars. Seal jars and process in a boiling water bath for 25 minutes. Check seal and store in a cool dark place. Can be stored for up to a year!
