# Root Vegetable Tian

`Want to make` `Thanksgiving` `Side dish` `Fall` `Special Meal`

Serves 6-8

**Ingredients:**

- 1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas, drained, 1/4 cup liquid reserved
- 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 2 small sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick rounds
- 3 medium-size red beets, peeled and sliced crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick rounds
- 3 parsnips, peeled and sliced diagonally into 1/8-inch-thick slices
- 2 small red onions, sliced crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick rounds
- 2 ounce Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated (about 1/2 cup)
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 3 garlic cloves, minced

**Directions:**

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Combine chickpeas, reserved 1/4 cup chickpea liquid, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a food processor; process until mixture is mostly smooth, about 30 seconds. Spread puree evenly on bottom of a 9-inch round (2-quart) baking dish. Starting at outer edge of dish, arrange groupings of 2 or 3 slices of each vegetable, layering and overlapping slightly, in 2 concentric circles, using chickpea puree to steady slices. Tuck remaining vegetable slices in center to fill up dish.
2. Stir together cheese and thyme in a small bowl. Brush top of vegetables with oil; sprinkle with pepper and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Scatter cheese mixture and garlic over tian.
3. Cover tightly with aluminum foil, place on a baking sheet, and roast in preheated oven 35 minutes. Uncover and roast until top is lightly browned and vegetables are tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
