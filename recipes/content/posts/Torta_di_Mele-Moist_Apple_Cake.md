# Torta di Mele  Moist Apple Cake

`Desserts` `Italian Inspired`

**Ingredients**      

5 apples

Juice of 1 lemon

1 cup sugar

Seeds scraped from 1 vanilla pod (or a few drops of good vanilla essence)

5 eggs

2 1/2 cups flour

2/3 cup butter

1 Tbsp Cream of tarter

1/2 Tbsp baking soda

1/2 Tbsp corn starch

2 2/5 cups flour

1/3 cup pine nuts, toasted       

**Directions**      

Preheat the oven to 340°F. 

Put the butter into a pot and melt in the oven, taking care that it doesn’t burn.

Peel the apples and cut them into small pieces. Add the lemon juice and (1/4 cup) of the sugar. Mix together and set aside.

Break the eggs into a large bowl. Add the remaining sugar and beat together well.

Add the melted butter, the vanilla, the flour and the natural baking powder, mixing well.

Add the apples. 

Put the mixture in a cake tin, sprinkle the toasted pine nuts on top. 

 ***Once you mix ingredients put in oven quickly as natural baking powder goes flat quickly.

Bake for 40 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean.

Serve with homemade ginger ice cream
