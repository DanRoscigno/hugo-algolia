# Chile Orange Chocolate Souffle

`Desserts` `Want to make`

Makes 4 soufflés 

### **Ingredients:**

_Soufflé:_

3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing ramekins

1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus extra for ramekins 

1/4 cup all-purpose flour 

1/4 cup milk 

1 teaspoon kosher salt 

Pinch chile flakes 

Zest of 1 orange 

5 large egg yolks plus 4 large egg whites, at room temperature 

3/4 cup chopped bittersweet (70 percent) chocolate

1/2 teaspoon white vinegar 

Powdered sugar, for garnish 

Creme Anglaise (optional)

_Creme Anglaise:_

1/2 cup heavy cream

1/2 cup whole milk 

1/4 cup granulated sugar 

1/8 teaspoon kosher salt 

3 large egg yolks 

1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped from the pods 

### **Directions:**

_Soufflé:_

1. Place the oven racks in the center and bottom of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Grease the insides of four 6-ounce souffle ramekins with butter. Add a small amount of granulated sugar to the interior of one ramekin, and coat thoroughly. Repeat with the remaining ramekins by turning the sugar out from the first into the second. Place the prepared ramekins on a sheet tray.
3. In a small bowl, combine the butter and flour into an evenly mixed mass. Combine the milk, salt, chile flakes, orange zest and 1/3 cup granulated sugar in a small pot. Bring to a simmer, then whisk in the butter and flour mixture until combined. Cook the mixture over a low heat until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat.
4. In a medium bowl, combine the egg yolks and add about 1/4 cup of the cooked flour and milk mixture. Whisk to combine to temper the egg yolks. Stir the chocolate into the remaining flour and milk mixture and mix until the chocolate is melted and well combined. Add the chocolate mixture to the tempered egg yolks and mix to combine and fully incorporate.
5. Soak a paper towel in the vinegar and wipe out the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the egg whites to the bowl and fit the stand mixer with a whisk attachment. Beat the whites on medium-high speed, slowly adding the remaining 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continuing to beat until you have stiff, glossy peaks, about 5 minutes.
6. Fold half of the egg white mixture into the chocolate base, followed by the remaining. (A few streaks of egg white is fine to remain, so as to not overmix.) Divide the mixture into the buttered and sugared ramekins, filling about three-quarters of the way. Gently tap the ramekins once on the sheet pan to evenly distribute the filling. Run your thumb around the rims of the ramekins to level and clean the edges. Bake, turning halfway through, until the edges are set but the centers are jiggly, about 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and place each ramekin on a plate. Garnish with a dusting of powdered sugar. Create a pocket in the center of each souffle to pour in the Creme Anglaise, if using. Enjoy warm.

_Creme Anglaise:_

1. In a medium pot, whisk together the heavy cream, milk, sugar, salt, egg yolks and vanilla seeds. Place the pot over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
2. Fill a large bowl with ice. Place a smaller bowl on top of the ice. Strain the anglaise into the smaller bowl and let cool completely.
