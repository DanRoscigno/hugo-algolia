# Grilled Salmon with Citrus Salsa Verde

`Salads` `Main Meal` `Picnic Fare` `Kim Acceptable` `Island Inspired`

 

  Ingredients  

  2 large oranges

1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

1/4 cup fresh lemon juice

1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

2 scallions, finely sliced

3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves

2 tablespoons capers, rinsed, drained and coarsely chopped

2 tablespoons orange zest

1 teaspoon lemon zest

1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Vegetable or canola oil, for oiling the grill

2 tablespoons amber agave nectar

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

  

   Directions  

  Salmon:

 * Vegetable or canola oil, for oiling the grill

 * 4 (4 to 5-ounce) center cut salmon fillets, skinned, each about 3-inches square

 * 2 tablespoons amber agave nectar

 * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the salsa: Peel and trim the ends from each orange. Using a paring knife, cut along the membrane on both sides of each segment. Free the segments and add them to a medium bowl. Add the olive oil, lemon juice, parsley, scallions, mint, capers, orange zest, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes. Toss lightly and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside.

For the salmon: Put a grill pan over medium-high heat or preheat a gas or charcoal grill. Brush the grilling rack with vegetable oil to keep the salmon from sticking. Brush the salmon on both sides with the agave nectar and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Grill until the fish flakes easily and is cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Transfer the salmon to a platter and allow to rest for 5 minutes.

Spoon the salsa verde on top of the salmon or serve on the side as an accompaniment.
