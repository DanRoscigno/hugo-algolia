- 1small [cinnamon stick](https://amzn.to/2LSjXam)( or 1/2 teaspoon)
- 1/2 teaspoon[cumin](https://amzn.to/2GvSmZW)
- 1/2 teaspoon[granulated garlic](https://amzn.to/34F61J1)( or onion)
- 1/2 teaspoon[salt](https://amzn.to/3gphtxC), more to taste
- 1 1/2cupdry couscous

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

**PREP EGGPLANT:**Quarter the eggplant, and cut into large chunks (1 1/2 inches at widest part). Place in a big bowl, cover with cool water just to enough to cover, Â and stir in the [salt](https://amzn.to/3gphtxC). Place a plate over top to keep the eggplant submerged 20 minutes. Drain and pat dry. (Donâ€™t rinse.)

**Preheat the oven to 375FÂ** 

**Pan Sear:**In a large [dutch oven](https://amzn.to/3d8TFlE), or ovenproof skillet, over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Working in 2 batches, brown two sides of the eggplant, until golden, then set these aside. No need to cook through.

**Make the stew:**Add more oil to the same pan, and the onion and saute 2-3 minutes, stirring. Add the garlic, celery and red pepper and lower heat, cook until tender about 5 minutes. Lower heat to low. Add the spices, canned tomatoes (and juices), Â raisins, [salt](https://amzn.to/3gphtxC), pepper, chickpeas and [veggie broth](https://amzn.to/3RTFqPK). Bring to simmer, stirring.

Nestle in the eggplant and give the pan a good shake so the stew levels. It should be like a stew-like. If it seems dry, add a little water. Drizzle with a little [olive oil](https://goto.target.com/c/2773249/81938/2092?subid1=56f42548dd56ec564339868e&subid2=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.feastingathome.com%2Feggplant-chickpea-tagine%2F&sharedid=feasting%20at%20home&subid3=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fcarapelli-100-organic-extra-virgin-olive-oil-17oz%2F-%2FA-52000954&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fcarapelli-100-organic-extra-virgin-olive-oil-17oz%2F-%2FA-52000954#donotlink), cover tightly and place in the warm oven.

Bake 20-25 minutes or until eggplant is tender and cooked through. While itâ€™s baking make the couscous.

Remove the lid, taste adding more [salt](https://amzn.to/3gphtxC)to taste, keeping in mind the couscous will soak up some of the [salt](https://amzn.to/3gphtxC). If you feel the stew needs more flavor overall, add a little more [ras el hanout](https://www.feastingathome.com/ras-el-hanout-recipe/), a 1/2 teaspoon at a time, tasting as you go. If it seems watery, bake uncovered for a few minutes. If dry, add a little water. To serve, Sprinkle with optional Â [Aleppo](https://bowlandpitcher.com/collections/spices-and-condiments/products/aleppo)chili flakes and fresh Parsley. I like adding an additional drizzle of [olive oil](https://goto.target.com/c/2773249/81938/2092?subid1=56f42548dd56ec564339868e&subid2=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.feastingathome.com%2Feggplant-chickpea-tagine%2F&sharedid=feasting%20at%20home&subid3=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fcarapelli-100-organic-extra-virgin-olive-oil-17oz%2F-%2FA-52000954&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fcarapelli-100-organic-extra-virgin-olive-oil-17oz%2F-%2FA-52000954#donotlink), or a dollop of yogurt, up to you.

Serve with the cinnamon-scented couscous.

**To make couscous:**Place broth, oil, spices and [salt](https://amzn.to/3gphtxC)in a [medium pot](https://amzn.to/2NQYUqA), and bring to boil. Stir in couscous. Cover and remove from heat. Let stand 7 minutes. Uncover and fluff with fork. Adjust [salt](https://amzn.to/3gphtxC).

### **NOTES**

Soaking the eggplant, not only seasons it, it helps remove some bitterness and helps the eggplant absorb less oil. Donâ€™t skip this step.
