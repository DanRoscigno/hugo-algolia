Serves 4-6

**Ingredients:**

Ground Chicken, 1½ pounds (preferably 97/3 lean to fat ratio) 

Red Peppers, ½ cup, finely chopped

Feta Cheese, ⅓ cup, crumbled

Fresh Spinach, 1 cup, chopped

Panko Crumbs, ⅓ cup

Garlic, 2 cloves, minced

Dried Oregano, 2 teaspoons

Salt, ½ teaspoon

Pepper, ¼ teaspoon

Fresh Lemon Juice, 1 tablespoon

**Instructions:**

_Prepare the Burger Mix:_

In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground chicken, chopped red peppers, crumbled feta cheese, chopped spinach, panko crumbs, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, pepper, and fresh lemon juice. Gently mix until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Be careful not to overmix to keep the burgers tender.

_Form Patties:_ 

Divide the mixture into equal portions, shaping each into a patty. This recipe should yield about 4 to 6 burgers, depending on your preferred size.

_Cook the Burgers:_ 

Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. If using a skillet, a drizzle of olive oil can prevent sticking. Place the patties on the grill or skillet, cooking for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked through and golden on the outside. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C) for safety.

_Serve:_ 

Place each burger on a plate and serve with sliced cucumber and additional spinach for a fresh, vibrant touch. These burgers are delicious on their own or can be served on whole-grain buns for a heartier meal.
