Makes 45 cookies

**INGREDIENTS:**

- 1cupsalted butter,softened
- 1/2cupsugar
- 1 1/2cupsall purpose flour
- 1tablespoonorange zest
- 1 1/2cupsfresh whole cranberries,chopped

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

- In a mixing bowl, use a hand-held mixer to beat together the butter and sugar. Beat for 3 minutes or until the mixture is light and fluffy. 
- Next, add the flour. If you used unsalted butter, add 1/4 teaspoon of salt now too. With your beater on a low setting, beat the dry ingredients into the butter and sugar mixture until well combined. 
- Finally, add in the orange zest and chopped cranberries. Use a wooden spoon to mix the zest and berries into the cookie batter.
- Finally, turn the dough out onto a sheet of parchment paper. Form the dough into a long log, about 45 centimeters or 18 inches in length. 
- Roll the log in the parchment paper and then into plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour. 
- When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Next, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with a silicone liner or with parchment paper and set it aside.
- Remove the plastic wrap and parchment paper from the cookie log. Using a sharp knife, cut the log into one centimeter or 3/8 inch slices. 
- Lay the slices onto the prepared baking sheet about an inch apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the bottom edge of the cookies have browned. Remove from oven and allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Remove and transfer cookies to a wire cooling rack to finish cooling.
