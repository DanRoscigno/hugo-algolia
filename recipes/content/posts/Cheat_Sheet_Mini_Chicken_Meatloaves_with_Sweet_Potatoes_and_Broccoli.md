4 ounces shredded Parmesan

3 cloves garlic, grated on a rasp 

2 scallions, finely chopped (white and green parts)

_Meatloaf Topping:_

1 cup pizza sauce

2 tablespoons honey 

1 tablespoon hot sauce 

Freshly ground black pepper 

_Veggies:_

One 1.5-pound bag steamable sweet potatoes

2 cups fresh broccoli florets (from about 1 head broccoli)

Zest of 2 lemons plus lemon wedges, for spritzing

Zest of 1 orange plus orange wedges, for spritzing

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 

1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 

3 tablespoons olive oil 

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 

### **Directions:**

###### Special equipment:

 nonstick aluminum foil

_Meatloaves:_ Line a sheet pan with nonstick aluminum foil and set aside. Add the ground chicken to a large bowl and break it up. Set aside. 

Combine the basil, parsley, onion, breadcrumbs, paprika, salt, pepper, cheese, garlic, scallions, bread and egg white in a medium bowl and stir until everything is blended. 

Add to the chicken and gently mix with your less dominant hand, turning the bowl with the dominant hand and using your fingers on the less dominant hand as a pitchfork, folding as you go, until mixed well. Form into 4 equal parts and and place on the lined sheet pan. Form into bricks of a similar size. Set aside.

_Meatloaf Topping:_ Heat the pizza sauce, honey, hot sauce and plenty of black pepper in a small saucepot on medium heat until it comes to a simmer. Simmer until it reduces and thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Set aside.

_Veggies:_ Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. 

Steam the sweet potatoes according to the package instructions, about 6 minutes. Slice into 1-inch-thick coins.

Combine the sweet potatoes in a large bowl with the broccoli, citrus zests, garlic powder and nutmeg. Drizzle with the olive oil and toss. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss again.

Add the vegetables to the sheet pan with the meatloaves by placing the sweet potatoes on first, surrounding the meatloaves, then pouring over the broccoli. 

Bake for 30 minutes, then remove and brush the meatloaves with the topping. 

Spritz the vegetables with juice from the orange and lemon wedges. 

Continue to bake until the internal temperature of the meatloaves registers 165 degrees F, about another 15 minutes.
