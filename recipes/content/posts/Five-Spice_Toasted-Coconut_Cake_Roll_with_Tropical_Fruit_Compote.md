## **Directions**

    **Step 1**
- To prepare cake, line the bottom of a 15 x 10-inch jelly roll pan with wax paper.
    **Step 2**
- Lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Combine flour, 6 tablespoons granulated sugar, and five-spice powder, stirring with a whisk.
    **Step 3**
- Place egg whites in a large bowl; beat with a mixer at high speed until foamy. Add cream of tartar and salt, and beat until soft peaks form. Add 6 tablespoons granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating until stiff peaks form. Beat in juice and extracts.
    **Step 4**
- Sift 1/4 cup flour mixture over egg white mixture; fold in. Repeat procedure with remaining flour mixture, 1/4 cup at a time. Spread batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup coconut. Bake at 325Â° for 20 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched.
    **Step 5**

Starting at narrow end, roll up cake and towel together. Place, seam side down, on wire rack; cool cake completely. Unroll cake, and remove towel. Spread sorbet over cake, leaving a 1/2-inch border around outside edges. Reroll cake. Wrap cake in plastic wrap; freeze 1 hour or until firm.
