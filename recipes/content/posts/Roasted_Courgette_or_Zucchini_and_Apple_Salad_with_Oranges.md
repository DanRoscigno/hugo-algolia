1 green apple,Â  cored, halved, and sliced

3 Tbsp olive oil

Juice of 1 lemon

1 Tbsp dark, clear honey

**Directions:**

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the sliced courgettes and apples in a baking dish. Spoon the oil over them. Roast for about 20 minutes. Take them out and pour the mix of lemon juice and honey over the courgettes/apples mixture. Cook for about 10 more minutes or until they are soft and golden. Leave to cool in the dish. 

Prepare the oranges on a plate so that you capture any juices. Slice the oranges thinly into circles, remove any pips, and arrange on a serving plate. Pour the roasted courgettes apple mixture on top of the oranges. Stir the orange juice that you caught on the plate into the remaining roasting juices from the pan and add sea salt to taste.
