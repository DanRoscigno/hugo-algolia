# Decadent Dulce De Leche Cheesecake

`Desserts` `Cheesecakes`

Servings: 12-15                   

**Ingredients:**

 _Crust:_

  1 cup graham cracker crumbs

  2 tablespoons brown sugar

 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 

_Cheesecake Filling:_

 1 14-oz. can dulce de leche caramel sauce, 1/3 cup reserved

 1 1/2 lbs. cream cheese, softened

 1/2 cup granulated sugar

 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

 4 eggs

 1/4 cup whipping cream

**Instructions:**

Mix all crust ingredients together by tossing together with a fork in the bottom of an 8 or 9 inch springform pan. Press into place to line pan bottom.

Preheat oven to 350°F.; Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Remove 1/3 cup dulce de leche and set aside.

Blend all cake ingredients (less 1/3 cup dulce) in the mixing bowl of an electric mixer, on the slowest speed, stopping to scrape sides and bottom of mixing bowl. Pour into prepared pan and place on baking sheet.

Bake the cheesecake for 20 minutes or until cake is barely set but not browned. Then, reduce heat to 325°F. and bake for another 15-20 minutes until cake is no longer jiggly in center. Turn off oven and let cake cool in oven, with door ajar, for about 45 minutes. Then refrigerate for 30 minutes, then cover pan with a plate and let cake chill for at least 8 hours, or overnight.

To garnish, heat reserved dulce de leche microwave in a Pyrex measuring cup for about 20-40 seconds on low power. Drizzle or pour over top of cake. Alternatively, you can also offer more dulce, warmed up, on the side, to spoon over individual servings.
