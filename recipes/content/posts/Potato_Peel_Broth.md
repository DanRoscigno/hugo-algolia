# Potato Peel Broth

`Soups`

Makes about 6 quarts of broth

**Ingredients:**

Peels from 6-7 large potatoes**, about ¼ inch thick

2 medium onions, cut into quarters – skin on

2 carrots, cut into large chunks

2 stalks celery, cut into 3 inch pieces

11/2 quarts water

½ bunch parsley

2 small cloves garlic, optional

Salt and pepper, to taste

**Optional:** 2 bay leaves or other seasonings to your liking

** Save the rest of the potato for another use. Store the unused potato in water to prevent oxidation (that‘s when potatoes turns brown when exposed to air), and store covered in the refrigerator.

**Directions:**

1. In a 8 quart pot, combine all ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.

2. Simmer for about 1 to 1 ½ hours, or until all vegetables are soft. Add more water, if necessary, to keep vegetables covered. Adjust the salt and pepper, if necessary.

3. For a clear broth, strain the solids and discard.

4. For a thin puree, press the broth and veggies through a sieve or strainer.

5. Cool the broth and store in the refrigerator, or freezer.

This broth can be used as a soup base, for pilaf recipes, sauces, etc. To enhance the broth’s flavor, try adding other herbs, such as basil, or other vegetables, such as parsnips.
