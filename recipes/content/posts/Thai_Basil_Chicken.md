# Thai Basil Chicken

`Main Meal` `Quick` `Asian Inspired`

3+ servings

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon fish sauce
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons brown sugar
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped
- 1/2 cup sliced shallots
- 8 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper (I have used dandicut peppers)
- 2 cups very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
- 4 cups hot cooked jasmine rice

**Directions:**

- Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.
    **Step 1**
- Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.
    **Step 2**
- Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.
    **Step 3**
- Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.
    **Step 4**
