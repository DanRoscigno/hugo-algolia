# Apple Cranberry Wheat Berry Salad

`Salads` `Want to make` `Side dish`

Servings: 4

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup uncooked wheat berries, rinsed
- Kosher salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp coarse ground Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp pure maple syrup
- 1 Tbsp apple cider or unsweetened apple juice
- 2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- ½ cup dried cranberries, preferably apple juice-sweetened (available at Whole Foods)
- ½ cup pecan halves, toasted and chopped
- 2 packed cups baby spinach, preferably organic
- 1 large apple, preferably organic, chopped

**Instructions:**

Cover wheat berries by 1 inch with water in a medium saucepan set over high heat. Add in a generous pinch of Kosher salt. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until chewy, about 45-50 minutes (taste and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes if you’d like). Drain and transfer to a medium bowl.

While wheat berries are cooking, whisk together the cider vinegar, mustard, maple syrup, apple cider, & olive oil in a small bowl (or shake together in a small jar). Season to taste with salt and pepper.

While the drained cooked wheat berries are still warm, toss with the vinaigrette. Taste, and add salt and pepper if desired. Stir in the cranberries, pecans, baby spinach, and apple.
