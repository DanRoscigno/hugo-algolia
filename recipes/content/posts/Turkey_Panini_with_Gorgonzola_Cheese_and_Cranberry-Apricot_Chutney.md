# Turkey Panini with Gorgonzola Cheese and Cranberry-Apricot Chutney

`Main Meal` `Want to make` `Sandwiches` `Picnic Fare` `American`

Servings: 4Â  Â  Â Â  

**Ingredients:Â  Â  Â  Â**  

8 slices walnut levain bread, each about 1/2 inch thick

4 Tbs. cranberry-apricot chutney (below)

8 oz. thinly sliced roast turkey 

4 oz. blue cheese, crumbled 

4 Tbs. mayonnaise (optional) 

1 cup arugula 

Olive oil for drizzling 

Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to tasteÂ  Â Â   

**Directions:Â  Â  Â  Â**  

Preheat an electric panini press on the â€œpaniniâ€ setting.

Place the bread slices on a work surface. Spread the chutney on 4 of the slices. Arrange the turkey on top, dividing evenly, and sprinkle with the cheese. Spread the mayonnaise on the remaining 4 bread slices and cover each sandwich with one of the slices, mayonnaise side down.

Place 2 sandwiches on the preheated panini press and close the lid. Cook until the bread is crisp and the cheese is melted, about 4 minutes. Transfer the sandwiches to a cutting board. Repeat to cook the remaining 2 sandwiches.

Put the arugula in a small bowl. Drizzle with enough olive oil to coat and season with salt and pepper. Open the sandwiches and arrange the arugula on each one. Close the sandwiches, cut in half and serve immediately.Â  Â  Â  Â
