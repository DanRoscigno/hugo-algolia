# Spicy Pirate Ribs with Lemon Mop

`Main Meal` `Picnic Fare`

Servings: 4       

**Ingredients:**

2 lbs. country-style spareribs with bone

2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely minced

_Rub:_

1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

1/2 tsp ground nutmeg

3/4 tsp salt

1/2 tsp black pepper

1/2 tsp ground cumin

1/4 tsp ground cloves

1/4 tsp ground allspice

1/4 cup brown sugar

3 Tbsp chili powder

1-1/2 tsp dried thyme, crushed

2 tsp powdered mustard

_Lemon Mop:_

1 Tbsp finely minced lemon zest

1/2 cup lemon juice

1/4 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup chili sauce

**Directions:**

Remove the membrane from the underside of the ribs, then place in a large rectangular dish or baking pan. Rub garlic over both sides of ribs.

Prepare the rub: Combine cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, pepper, cumin, cloves, allspice, brown sugar, chili powder, thyme and powdered mustard. Rub the mixture evenly on both sides of the ribs. Marinate, refrigerated, at least 15 minutes, or up to 8 hours for more flavor.

Prepare the lemon mop: Stir together the lemon zest, juice, brown sugar and chili sauce. Refrigerate if not using right away.

To roast the ribs: Heat oven to 350 degrees (F). Place ribs, meaty side up, on a rack in a foil-lined roasting pan. Place a small pan of water on bottom oven rack and roast the ribs until the meat begins to pull away from the ends of the bone, about 75 minutes, basting occasionally with the lemon mop. Stop basting about 15 minutes before removing the ribs from the oven. (The ribs can also be grilled over medium coals on an oiled rack for 75 minutes.)

Let ribs rest 5 minutes before cutting.
