# Dried Stovetop Simmer Pots

`Gifts` `Room scent`

**Potential Ingredients:**

- 3-4 fresh rosemary and lavender clippings from my own garden
- Dried orange slices
- Dried lemon slices
- 1-2 cinnamon sticks
- 1 tablespoon(ish) whole cloves
- 1 teaspoon(ish) of both nutmeg and ground cinnamon
- 3-4 star anise

**Directions:**

- Slice citrus _very_ thinly. You can use a serrated knife to help, but a mandoline slicer works best.
- Turn the oven on its lowest setting and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
- Lay each slice of fruit out on the baking sheet and place in the oven to dry out. Give yourself several hours! (The key to preserving the fruit for a longer shelf life is making sure theyâ€™re _completely_ dried out. 
- Check the fruit every 45-60 minutes and flip them over each time until complete dried. 
- Let cool before putting together with other ingredients.
