# Goat Cheese and Dill Dutch Baby

`Breakfasts`

Yield:  6 servings

**INGREDIENTS:**

- 1cup  crumbled plain goat cheese
- ½cup chopped fresh dill, plus picked fronds for garnish
- 2tablespoons olive oil
- 1lemon
- Coarse kosher salt, such as Morton
- Ground black pepper
- 1cup all-purpose flour
- 8large eggs
- ¾cup whole milk
- 4tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2cups watercress leaves with tender stems, or other tender greens such as spinach or arugula
- 1tablespoon honey

**PREPARATION:**

1. In a small bowl, combine goat cheese, ¼ cup dill and 1 tablespoon oil. Zest lemon over mixture, season with a pinch each of salt and pepper and let sit to marinate.
    **Step 1**
2. Heat oven to 425 degrees with a rack in the lower third. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon black pepper. Add remaining ¼ cup dill and stir. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs and milk. Whisk wet ingredients into dry until just combined.
    **Step 2**
3. Melt butter in a heavy 12-inch ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Let it cook until it smells nutty and browns, about 5 minutes, swirling the skillet so that butter coats the bottom and sides of the pan.
    **Step 3**
4. Pour batter into the hot buttered skillet and spoon half of the marinated goat cheese into the center of the batter. Bake until puffed and golden, 20 to 22 minutes.
    **Step 4**
5. To serve, cool the Dutch baby slightly in the pan, 5 to 6 minutes. Top with watercress and dill fronds. Spoon remaining goat cheese on top and drizzle with honey and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Slice the lemon and squeeze a wedge over the greens. Serve immediately.
    **Step 5**
