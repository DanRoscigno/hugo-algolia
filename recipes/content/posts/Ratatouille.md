Serves 4-6

**Ingredients:**

1Tbsp extra virgin olive oil

1 lg. onion, peeled and diced

1lg. clove of garlic, minced

1 pound zucchini, sliced 1” thick

1 pound eggplant, peeled and sliced 1” thick

1 pound tomatoes, quartered

1 lg. green pepper, seeded and sliced

1 rib celery, uncut

1 small bunch fresh thyme

1 whole bay leaf

Salt to taste

Freshly ground pepper to taste

Fresh thyme for garnish 

Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

Garlic, chopped for garnish

**Equipment:** Tall 6 quart casserole dish

**Directions:**

Heat olive oil over medium heat in casserole. Add onion and cook over low heat for 5 minutes, then add garlic and cook for 2-5 minutes more, stirring often.

Add zucchini, eggplant, tomatoes, green pepper, celery, thyme, bay leaf, salt and pepper. Mix well to combine ingredients . Cover casserole and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until juices are near the top of vegetables, about 30 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook for approximately 30 minutes, or until desired texture is reached. The mixture should be thick and the liquid should have evaporated. 

Remove tomato skins, celery rib, and thyme; they should float to the top. Drain any excess liquid, if necessary. Pour into a serving dish and garnish with fresh thyme, parsley, and garlic, if desired.
