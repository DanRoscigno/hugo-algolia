# Cherry Sauce

`Want to make` `Gifts` `Condiments`

Makes ~ 1 1/4 cups

### Ingredients:

- 2 Cups of frozen sweet cherries pitted about 280g
- ¼ cup water
- 1 Tablespoon cornstarch
- ¼ cup - ½ cup sugar
- ½ -1 teaspoon almond extract

### Instructions:

- In a sauce pan over medium heat add cherries, sugar and mix well. Stir constantly.
- After about 4-5 minutes you will notice that the cherries have released their juices and the sugar has dissolved.
- Break the cherries apart with a spatula into halves if desired.
- Dissolve cornstarch in water and set aside.
- Pour cornstarch mixture over and stir, keep cooking until mixture thickens.
- Remove from heat and add almond extract.
- Let it cool down then scoop into a jar to use.

### Notes:

- I do not like super sweet cherry sauce so I think ¼ cup of sugar is fairly enough but it is subject to your liking.
- Also adding almond extract depends on your liking and how strong the almond extract you are using is.
- You can also flavor the sauce with any extract of choice but almond goes pretty well with cherries.
- **Storage:**Store cherry sauce in the fridge for up to 5 days. Always use a clean dry spoon when scooping from the jar.
