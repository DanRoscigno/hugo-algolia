# Sunny's 5-Ingredient Lemon and Cheese Peas

`Want to make` `Side dish`

Makes 8-12 servings

### **Ingredients:**

1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) olive oil or salted butter

2 cloves garlic, minced or grated on a rasp grater

Zest and juice of 1 lemon 

4 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, gently chopped 

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 

4 cups fresh spring, English or snow peas 

8 to 12 ounces shaved or grated Pecorino-Romano cheese 

### **Directions:**

1. In a pan on medium-low heat, add the olive oil (or butter), garlic and lemon zest. Cook, stirring, so the garlic and zest can steep without browning, about 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice, thyme, a pinch of salt and a few more grinds of black pepper than you normally would. Move the contents of the pan around a bit more while cooking, until the thyme is darker in color and the pan is fragrant, about 5 more minutes.
2. Add the peas and toss to warm and coat, about 4 minutes. Pour into a serving dish and top with the cheese.
