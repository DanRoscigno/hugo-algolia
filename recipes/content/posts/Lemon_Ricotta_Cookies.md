# Lemon Ricotta Cookies

`Want to make` `Cookies` `Italian Inspired`

Makes ~ 42 cookies (dough can be frozen for future batches)

**Ingredients:**

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking powder 

1/4 teaspoon fine salt 

1 cup granulated sugar 

1/2 cup (1 stick) salted butter, softened 

1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 

1/4 cup honey 

2 large eggs, at room temperature 

One 15-ounce container ricotta cheese, at room temperature 

1/2 teaspoon almond extract 

2 lemons, juiced (about 1/4 cup juice) 

1/2 cup crystallized lemon peel, chopped 

1/4 cup raw sugar 

**Directions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium mixing bowl. Set aside.
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large mixing bowl using a hand mixer), add the granulated sugar, butter and brown sugar. Mix on medium speed until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the honey and continue mixing for 30 seconds more to combine. Turn the machine off and add the eggs individually, mixing on low after each addition. Add the ricotta, almond extract and lemon juice and mix on medium-low speed for about 2 minutes more. The dough should look slightly granular but free of lumps.
4. Add half of the sifted dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the remainder of the dry ingredients. Mix one last time on low speed until all of the ingredients are combined and the dough is fluffy.
5. Scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet by heaping tablespoons, making sure to leave space in between each cookie, as they will spread while baking. Sprinkle the chopped lemon peel and raw sugar over the cookies.
6. Bake until light golden on the bottom edges, about 15 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet before moving to a cooling rack. Repeat this process until all of the dough is baked. Once completely cooled, store the cookies in an airtight container.
