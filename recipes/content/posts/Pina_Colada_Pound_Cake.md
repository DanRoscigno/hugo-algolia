**Ingredients:Â  Â  Â**  Â  

Cake:

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature

2 cups sugar

4 eggs

1 container (8 ounce size) vanilla yogurt

1/4 cup canned crushed pineapple

1 teaspoon grated lime rind

1 teaspoon coconut extract

1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Glaze:

2 teaspoons fresh lime juice

1/2 cup confectioners' sugar

Garnish:

Shredded sweetened coconut

Thin strips lime and lemon rind

**Directions:**

Prepare cake: Heat oven to 325Â°. Grease a 12-cup Bundt pan. Lightly dust with flour; tap out excess flour.

Whisk together flour, baking soda and salt in a medium-size bowl until well mixed.

Beat together butter and sugar in second bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.

Mix together yogurt, pineapple and lime rind in small bowl.

On low speed, beat flour mixture into butter mixture in 3 additions, alternating with the yogurt mixture, starting and ending with the flour mixture. 

Add coconut extract and vanilla, and beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Pour the batter into prepared pan.

Bake in 325Â° oven for 60 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Transfer pan to wire rack and cool for about 15 to 20 minutes. Turn out cake onto rack; turn right side up. Cool completely.

Prepare glaze: Whisk together lime juice and confectioners' sugar in small bowl until good drizzling consistency. Drizzle over cake. Garnish with shredded coconut and lemon and lime rind OR serve with grilled pineapple with rum sauce (see recipe). Â Â
