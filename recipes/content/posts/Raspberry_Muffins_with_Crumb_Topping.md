# Raspberry Muffins with Crumb Topping

`Breads` `Summer`

Makes 18 regular sized muffins

**Ingredients:**

_For the topping:_

1/2 cup all purpose flour

1/2 cup sugar

1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

_For the muffins:_

Vegetable oil spray for the pans

2 3/4 cups all purpose flour

3 tsp baking powder

1 1/4 tsp baking soda

1/2 tsp salt 

1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temp

1 1/2 cups sugar 

4 large eggs

1/2 tsp vanilla extract 

1 1/2 cups sour cream

2 1/2 cups raspberries, fresh or frozen

**Directions:**

Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.

_Topping:_

Mix dry ingredients and add butter with fork. Mix until homogeneous and crumbly. Set aside.

_Muffins:_

Spray tins with veg oil. Whisk dry ingredients together until blended. Beat the butter and sugar together on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing the batter on low speed until smooth after each addition and scraping down the sides and bottom after each addition. Add the vanilla and mix to combine. 

Add about 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the batter, and mix on low speed until blended. Add 1/2 of sour cream, mix, and repeat with another 1/3 of the dry ingredients, the rest of the sour cream, and the remaining dry ingredients, mixing between each addition. Use a wooden spatula to stir in the raspberries by hand. 

Fill the prepared muffin tins until almost full, and sprinkle 1 Tablespoon full of topping onto each muffin. 

Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes.
