# The Monster Chip

`Cookies`

 

  Ingredients  

  Preheat oven to slow 325 degrees. Lightly grease 2 large cookie sheets. Break 3 bars (3 ounces each) semi sweet chocolate into squares; then cut each square diagonally in half. Set aside 1/2 cup pecan halves; coarsely chop 3/4 cup pecans. Stir together 1 cup + 2 Tbsp unsifted flour and 1/2 tsp baking soda, mix well.

Beat together 1/2 cup butter, 1/3 cup smooth peanut butter, 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar, until light and fluffy. Beat in 1 egg and 1 tsp vanilla.

Stir in flour mixture until blended. Stir in chopped pecans. Using 1/4 cup measure cup and shape dough into 12 rounds. Space rounds evenly on prepared cookie sheets. Push chocolate pieces and reserved pecan halves into mounds.

Bake for 15-17 mins or until golden brown around edges and only lightly colored on top (**check at 13 mins).
