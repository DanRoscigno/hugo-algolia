# Roasted Pepper and Chicken Soup

`Soups` `Kim Acceptable` `Winter`

Serves 8-10 (~10 1/2 cups)

**Ingredients:**

4 large sweet red pepper

4 large sweet yellow peppers

2 large green peppers

Vegetable cooking spray

1 Tbsp olive oil

4 (4 oz) chicken breast halves skinned and boned

6 1/2 cups chicken broth

1/2 tsp salt

1/4 tsp pepper

1/2 tsp dried whole basil

1/2 tsp dried marjoram

**Directions:**

Wash and dry peppers; place on a baking sheet, and broil 4 inches from heat 3-4 mins on each side. Put peppers in a plastic bag; close tightly, and let stand 10 minutes to loosen skins.

Peel peppers; remove and discard core and seeds. Cut peppers into 1/4 x 2 inch strips; set aside. Coat a large nonstick skillet with olive oil and place over medium-high heat until hot. Add chicken, and cook 15 minutes or until golden brown, turning once. Remove chicken from skillet. And cool slightly; cut into thin strips. Add pepper strips to skillet, and cook 2 to 3 minutes or just until tender, stirring often. 

Bring broth to a boil in a Dutch oven. Add salt, pepper, basil, marjoram, chicken, and peppers; simmer 5 minutes.
