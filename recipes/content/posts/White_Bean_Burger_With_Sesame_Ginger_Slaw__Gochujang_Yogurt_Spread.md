 Total Time 30 minutes

 Servings **4**

 

### Ingredients

Burger Patties:

15 ounce can of cannellini beans-white kidney beans, rinsed and drained

3/4 cup panko bread crumbs

1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions

1/4 cup roasted peanuts

2 cloves of garlic minced

2 tsp freshly grated ginger

2 TBSP hoisin sauce

2 TBSP Kikkoman Low Sodium Soy Sauce

1 TBSP olive oil

4 fresh burger buns

Sprouts for garnish

**Sesame Ginger Slaw:**

2 cups of shredded or julienned cabbage

1 cup shredded or spiralized carrot

1/4 cup pickled red ginger (Kizami Beni Shoga, pickled in plum vinegar, sliced into thin strips; OR 1 tsp freshly grated ginger)

Juice of half a lime

1 TBSP toasted sesame oil

1 TBSP vinegar

1 TBSP toasted sesame seeds optional

**Gochujang Yogurt Spread:**

1 cup plain Greek yogurt

1 TBSP gochujang hot sauce * See notes gradually add more if you want more heat

2 tsp Kikkoman soy sauce

### Instructions

**Burger Patties:**

In a blender or food processor, add the cannellini beans, **1/4 of the** panko bread crumbs, scallions, peanuts, garlic, ginger, hoisin sauce, and soy sauce. Pulse until everything is broken down and will hold together. (It's okay if a few scallions and peanuts are still in full form).

Shape the bean mixture into four 1/2-inch-thick patties.

Put the remaining 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs in a shallow dish.

Lightly brush both sides of each patty with oil, and dip the patties into the bread crumbs, turning to coat.

Preheat a large skillet over moderate heat.

Carefully add the patties to skillet and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until heated through, flipping the patties once halfway through. (If the patties brown too quickly, reduce heat to medium-low.)

**Sesame Ginger Slaw:**

Place all of the ingredients in a large bowl and toss until everything is evenly coated. Set aside.

**Gochujang Yogurt Spread:**

In a small bowl, mix together the yogurt, hot sauce and soy sauce. Mix well, and taste. Add more hot sauce to meet your preference.

**Assembly:**

Place the burgers onto their buns and top with slaw and sprouts.

Take the top half of the bun and slather on the yogurt sauce.

Close your burger and enjoy.

### Notes

**For the Gochujang Yogurt Spread**, you could replace the gochujang hot sauce with wasabi (start with 1 tsp if so), Sriracha, sambal oelek or soy sauce. Always start with less than you think you need and gradually add more to taste.
