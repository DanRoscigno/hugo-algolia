- 1Â and 2/3 cups (333g)Â granulated sugar
- 4Â largeÂ eggs, at **room temperature**
- 1 teaspoonÂ pure vanilla extract
- zest fromÂ 2Â orangesÂ (aboutÂ 2 packedÂ Tablespoons)
- juice fromÂ 2Â orangesÂ (aboutÂ 1/2 cupÂ fresh juice)
- 3/4 cupÂ (180ml)Â buttermilk, at **room temperature***

### **Easy Orange Glaze**

- 1Â and 1/4 cups (150g)Â siftedÂ confectionersâ€™ sugar
- 2â€“3Â Tablespoons (30-45ml) freshÂ orange juice
- 1/2 teaspoonÂ pure vanilla extract

### **Instructions**

1. Lower the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350Â°F (177Â°C). Spray the inside of aÂ 10 inch bundt panÂ with nonstick spray or grease thoroughly with butter. Set aside.

1. **MakeÂ the cake:**Â Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together. Set aside.

1. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy â€“ about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed together.Â Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.Â Add the eggsÂ and the vanilla. Beat on medium-high speed until combined.Â Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in the orange zest and juice. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk and mixing each addition just until incorporated. Do not overmix. The batter will be slightly thick.
2. Pour/spoon the batter evenly into the bundt pan. Bake for 45-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cover the cake loosely with aluminum foil if you begin to see the top browning quickly. Once done, remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes inside the pan.
3. Invert the slightly cooled bundt cake onto a wire rack set over a large plate or serving dish. Allow cake to cool before glazing and serving.
4. **Make the glaze:**Â Whisk the confectionersâ€™ sugar, 2 Tablespoons of orange juice, and vanilla together. It will be very thick. Whisk in 1 orÂ more Tablespoons of juice, depending how thick youâ€™d like the glaze. Drizzle over cake. Slice and serve.
