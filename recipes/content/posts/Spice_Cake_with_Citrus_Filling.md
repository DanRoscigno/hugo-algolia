1 cup butter, softened

2 cups sugar

3 large eggs

3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 1/2 cups buttermilk

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon ground allspice

1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

**Citrus Filling:**

Combine and mix:

2Â  1/2 cups lemon curdÂ 

1â€‰Â½ cups sweetened flaked coconutÂ 

1 tablespoon orange zestÂ 

1 tablespoon fresh orange juice.

**White Icing:**

2 egg whitesÂ 

1â€‰Â¼ cups sugarÂ 

1 tablespoon corn syrupÂ 

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Directions:**

_Cake:_

- Preheat oven to 350Â°. Bake pecans in a single layer in a shallow pan 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant, stirring halfway through. Let cool.
    **Step 1**
- Meanwhile, beat butter at medium speed with a heavy-duty electric stand mixer until creamy. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until blended after each addition.
    **Step 2**
- Stir together flour, baking soda, and salt; add to butter mixture alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Beat at low speed just until blended after each addition. Stir in vanilla.
    **Step 3**
- Divide batter into 2 equal portions (about 3 1/2 cups each); stir cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and pecans into 1 portion. Pour plain batter into 2 greased and floured 9-inch round cake pans (about 1 3/4 cups batter per pan). Pour spiced batter into 2 greased and floured 9-inch round cake pans (about 2 cups batter per pan).
    **Step 4**
- Bake at 350Â° for 18 to 20 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pans on wire racks 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks, and cool completely (about 1 hour).
    **Step 5**
- Place 1 plain cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand; spread top with 2/3 cup Filling, leaving a 1/4-inch border around edges. Top with a spice cake layer, and spread top with Filling as directed above. Repeat procedure with remaining plain cake layer and Filling. Top with remaining spice cake layer. Prepare White Icing; spread icing over top and sides of cake.
    **Step 6**

_Icing:_

- Pour water to depth of 1 1/2 inches into a 3 1/2-qt. saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer.

- Combine egg whites, sugar, next 2 ingredients, and 1/4 cup water in a 2 1/2-qt. glass bowl; beat mixture at high speed with an electric mixer until blended. Place bowl over simmering water, and beat at high speed 5 to 7 minutes or until soft peaks form; remove from heat. Beat icing to spreading consistency (about 2 to 3 minutes). Use immediately.
