Place cubed butter in freezer for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, measure other ingredients (except buttermilk and fruit) and mix in the bowl of a food processor.

 

Add butter to processor bowl and mix until the butter and flour mixture are the texture of coarse cornmeal. Add buttermilk and fruit, mixing and carefully pulse until the dough just comes together in a bowl.

 

Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently a couple times. Roll dough out to approximately one-inch thickness and cut into rounds. 

 

Bake on an ungreased baking sheet for 25 to 30 minutes, until lightly browned. After they cool a few minutes dip in lemon glaze. Best served warm!
