**Ingredients:Â  Â  Â**  

_Pound Cake:_

Vegetable cooking spray

1 (10.75-ounce) frozen pound cake, thawed and cut into 9 (1-inch) slices

2 tablespoons butter, melted

1/3 cup honey, for drizzling

_Citrus Cream:_

8 ounces mascarpone cheese

1/2 cup whipping cream

1/4 cup granulated sugar

1 tablespoon fresh orange juice

1 lemon, zested and juiced

1 lime, zested and juiced

_For the pound cake:_ 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a baking pan with cooking spray. Arrange the pound cake in a single layer on the prepared pan. Brush with the melted butter and drizzle with honey. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes or until lightly golden. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes.

_For the citrus cream:_ 

In a medium bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat all the ingredients together until stiff peaks form, about 1 minute.
