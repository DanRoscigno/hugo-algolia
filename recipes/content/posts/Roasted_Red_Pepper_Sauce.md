# Roasted Red Pepper Sauce

`Condiments` `Italian Inspired`

Makes 1 1/2 cups

**Ingredients:**

1 1/2 cups (about a 340-milliliter/11.5-ounce jar) roasted red peppers, drained

1/4 cup roughly chopped almonds, toasted

2 tablespoons roughly chopped oil-packed sundried tomatoes

2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped

1 small handful flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped

1 lemon, zested and juiced

1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika

3 to 5 tablespoons (45 to 75 milliliters) extra virgin olive oil

Kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

**Directions:**

1. In the bowl of a food processor or a high speed blender, combine the roasted red peppers, almonds, sundried tomatoes, garlic, parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice and smoked paprika. Pulse a few times to chop and mix. Add in 3 tablespoons of oil and blend into a smooth sauce, adding more oil if needed. Taste and season with salt and pepper and a bit more lemon juice, if needed.
