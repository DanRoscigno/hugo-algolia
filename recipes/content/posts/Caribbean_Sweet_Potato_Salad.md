# Caribbean Sweet Potato Salad

`Picnic Fare` `Side dish` `Island Inspired`

- 1 large russet potato, peeled and quartered
    1 large sweet potato, peeled and quartered
    1 cup corn
    1 teaspoon prepared Dijon-style mustard
    2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
    3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
    1 clove garlic, minced
    3 tablespoons canola oil
    ½ teaspoon salt
    ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
    1 cucumber, halved lengthwise and chopped
    ½ red onion, thinly sliced
    ¼ cup finely chopped peanuts
    **Ingredients:**

**Directions:**

**Step 1**

Place the Russet potato pieces into a large saucepan, and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, turn the heat down, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the sweet potato, and cook about 15 minutes more. Remove a piece of each potato, and cut it in half to see if it is cooked enough. Once the potatoes are tender, add corn kernels; cook another 30 seconds. Drain through a colander. Fill the saucepan with cold water, and drop vegetables into water. Cool for 5 minutes, and drain.

**Step 2**

In a large bowl, whisk together mustard, lime juice, cilantro, and garlic. Slowly whisk in oil. Mix in salt and black pepper.

**Step 3**

Cut cooled potatoes into 1 inch cubes, and add to dressing along with cucumber, and red onion. Toss well. Serve at room temperature or chilled. Toss the peanuts in just before serving.
