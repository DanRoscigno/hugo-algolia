# Gluten free Banana Pecan Muffins

`Breads` `Gluten Free`

1 3/4 cups (206g) King Arthur Gluten-Free Measure for Measure Flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

1/4 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon [cinnamon](https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/vietnamese-cinnamon-3-oz)

3/4 cup (149g) sugar

1/2 cup (57g) chopped walnuts or pecans, optional

1/2 cup (99g) vegetable oil

2 large eggs

1 teaspoon [vanilla extract](https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/pure-vanilla-extract-16-oz)

1 1/2 cups (340g) mashed ripe bananas (about 3 medium or 2 large bananas)

#### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375°F. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan, or line it with papers.

Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, sugar, and nuts. Set aside.

Stir together the oil, eggs, vanilla, and mashed bananas.

Combine the dry and wet ingredients, stirring until well combined.

Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups.

Bake the muffins for 20 to 24 minutes, until the middle of a center muffin springs back when lightly touched.

Remove the pan from the oven, and let the muffins rest for 5 minutes before removing them from the pan.

Serve muffins warm or at room temperature. Wrap any leftovers airtight, and store at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.
