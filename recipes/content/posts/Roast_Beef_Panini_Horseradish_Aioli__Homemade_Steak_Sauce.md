Servings:Â  Â  4Â  Â  Â  

**Ingredients:Â  Â**  

2 French-style baguette loaves, each at least 14 inches long 

8 slices Cheddar cheese, 6 to 8 ounces total weight 

1-1/2 pounds thinly sliced roast beef 

1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

_Roast Beef Panini Horseradish Aioli:_

1/2 cup store-bought mayonnaise 

2 tablespoons bottled prepared horseradish 

2 garlic cloves, minced 

_HOMEMADE STEAK SAUCE:_

Makes about 3 cups (750 ml)

3 cups tomato ketchup 

1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar 

1/2 cup seedless raisins 

1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 

1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 

2 tablespoons molasses 

2 teaspoons onion powder 

1 teaspoon minced garlic 

2 small fresh organic hot chili peppers, halved, stemmed, seeded, deveined, and minced 

2 sprigs fresh oregano, or 1/2 tablespoon dried oreganoÂ  Â  Â  

 **Directions:Â  Â  Â**  

 Â  Â  Â  Â  

Preheat an electric panini press or hinged double-sided electric contact grill.

With a bread knife, cut each baguette into 2 pieces 7 inches long, trimming off the pointy ends of the loaves. With the bread knife, split each piece in half lengthwise.

_Horseradish Aioli:_

In a small mixing bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, horseradish, and garlic. Spread the cut sides of each piece of bread with the mayonnaise mixture.

On the bottom half of each sandwich, place a slice of Cheddar. Arrange the roast beef evenly on top, then top the beef with another slice of cheese. Neatly place the top bread half on each sandwich.

Brush the hot top and bottom cooking surfaces of the panini press with olive oil. Working in batches if necessary, place the sandwiches in the panini press and cook until the cheese has melted and the bread is a deep golden brown, about 5 minutes.

Using tongs or a spatula, transfer the sandwiches to a cutting board and, with the bread knife, cut them diagonally in halves. Transfer to serving plates and pass some of the steak sauce alongside for each person to spread inside the sandwich or dip into bite by bite.

HOMEMADE STEAK SAUCE

Combine all the ingredients in a large saucepan. Place the pan over medium heat and bring to a gentle boil, stirring frequently with a wire whisk. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the flavors have blended and the sauce is thick, 30 to 45 minutes, whisking frequently to prevent the sauce from scorching on the bottom of the pan.

Remove the pan from the heat. Place a fine-meshed wire strainer over a bowl and pour the sauce into the strainer, pressing it through with a rubber spatula. Serve hot; or let the sauce cool to room temperature and then store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 to 5 days, serving it cold or gently reheated.Â  Â  Â
