Stir together first 4 ingredients; reserve half of mixture.

Cut chicken in half, and sprinkle evenly with salt and pepper. Place chicken in a large freezer bag, and pour half of teriyaki mixture over chicken; seal bag, and chill 8 hours, turning chicken, if desired.

Remove chicken from marinade, discarding marinade. Place chicken, skin side up, on an aluminum foil-lined 15- x 10-inch jellyroll pan.
