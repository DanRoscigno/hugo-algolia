**Ingredients:**

10 small zucchini 

1/2 lb. Chilled Gorgonzola cheese, cut into small pieces

2 pints cherry tomatoes, sliced thinly 

Baby basil leaves

1/3 lb. Parmesan cheese, finely grated

Freshly ground pepper

Directions:

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Wash the zucchini and slice them in 1/2 “ rounds. With a melon baller, scoop out the center, leaving the bottom intact. Place 1/2 tsp Gorgonzola on each round. Next, position a slice of cherry tomato on each round. Top each round with basil that has been rolled up and sliced across. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and pepper. Place the zucchini rounds on the baking sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes. The cheese should be melted but not browned. Garnish with more basil. Serve immediately.
