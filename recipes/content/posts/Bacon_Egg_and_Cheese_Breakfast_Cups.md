# Bacon Egg and Cheese Breakfast Cups

`Want to make` `Breakfasts` `Camping`

Makes 12 cups (One serving is two egg cups)

**Ingredients:**

- 6 strips of bacon
- 2 stalks of green onion, chopped
- 12 large eggs
- 1-½ cups ricotta cheese
- 5 ozs. smoky cheddar cheese, grated
- 1 teaspoon salt 

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

- Line a microwave-safe dinner plate with paper towel. Lay the bacon strips side-by-side on the plate. Cover with another paper towel. Microwave on high for 4-6 minutes. Set aside and crumble when cool.
    Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C).
- Meanwhile, crack eggs into a medium glass or ceramic bowl or into the bowl of an electric stand mixer. Add ricotta and mix at high speed for 2-3 minutes. Stir in cheddar cheese, green onion, crumbled bacon and salt. Stir until well-blended and cheddar cheese is well-distributed.
- Fill the bottom of a broiler pan or shallow baking pan halfway with water. Make sure you choose a pan that is large enough so that your muffin pan can fit inside. Place your muffin pan inside the baking pan. The water only needs to be high enough to cover the entire bottom of each muffin cup. You do not want water to spill over the top and into your egg mixture.
    Spray the cups of a 12-cup muffin pan with cooking spray. Ladle or pour egg mixture into each cup. Fill each cup to the top with the mixture.
- Bake in the water bath for 35-40 minutes. For more even baking, turn the pans around after about 20 minutes of baking. The egg cups are done when the centers are set.
- Remove muffin pan from the oven and water bath. Allow to cool in pan on a wire rack. Once cool, you can use a knife the loosen the sides of each egg cup and remove them from the pan.
