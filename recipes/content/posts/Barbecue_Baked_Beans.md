# Barbecue Baked Beans

`Picnic Fare` `Side dish`

6 Servings

**Ingredients:**

5 slices bacon, cooked and diced

1 small yellow onion, diced

1/3 red bell pepper, seeded and diced

1 pound dried navy beans 

1/3 cup barbecue sauce

1/8 cup molasses

1/3 cup apple cider vinegar

1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar

1 1/2 teaspoons hot yellow mustard powder

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

**Directions:**

- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
- Heat an oven-proof heavy-bottom pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook, stirring often, until the fat has started to render and the bacon is beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the onions and bell pepper and continue to cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are slightly softened, about 3 minutes.  
- Cook the dried navy beans with 1 quart of chicken broth for 40 mins. Cool some. Place in a baking pan.
- Add the barbecue sauce, molasses, vinegar, Worcestershire, brown sugar, mustard powder, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper in a sauce pan. Bring to a simmer and let cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.
- Add the sauce to the beans. Stir in the bacon pieces. 
- Transfer the beans to the oven and bake (uncovered) until the sauce thickens and the beans on top begin to brown, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving warm or at room temperature.
