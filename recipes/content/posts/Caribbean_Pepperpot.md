**Ingredients:**

_Soup:_

6 Tbsp corn oil

1 cup onions, diced

3 garlic cloves, finely chopped

2 cups potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4 inch dice

1/2 tsp bouillon powder; dissolved in 11/4 cups hot water

1 cup white cabbage, diced

13/4 cups canned chopped tomatoes 

1 heaping tsp ground coriander

Dash Tabasco

1/2 tsp chili powder

1 piece fresh chili pepper, finely chopped

21/4 cups coconut milk

Pinch of soft brown sugar (optional)

_For the peppers:_

1 Tbsp corn oil

1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/4 inch dice

1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1/4 inch dice

Tabasco

1-2 Tbsp tamari

**Directions:**

_Soup:_

Heat the oil and sauté the diced onion and garlic until transparent. Add the diced potatoes and cook until they too are transparent. Add 5 Tbsp of hot bouillon, stir, and cook for 1 minute or so. Then add the diced cabbage and sauté for 2-3 minutes. Drain the chopped tomatoes, reserving the juice. Add the tomatoes to the soup together with paprika, ground coriander, Tabasco, and chili powder. Stir well and add a further 3/4 cup of hot bouillon, the reserved tomato juice, and the fresh chili pepper. Simmer gently for 7-8 minutes and add the coconut milk. Check the sweetness of the soup and, if necessary, add a pinch of soft brown sugar. 

_For the bell peppers:_

Heat the oil in a skillet and sauté the diced bell peppers for just a minute, until they begin to blacken in places. Add a drop or two of Tabasco and tamari to taste, and set aside. 

To serve, mix half of the bell peppers into the soup and reserve the rest to use as garnish on each serving or in the soup tureen.
