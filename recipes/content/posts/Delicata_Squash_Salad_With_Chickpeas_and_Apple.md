Serves 4-6

**Ingredients:**

- 1 large delicata squash (13 ounces)
- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 3 teaspoons maple syrup, divided
- 1/2 teaspoon curry powder
- 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt, divided
- 1/2 cup hulled pumpkin seeds
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 large head red leaf lettuce, torn (lightly packed 8 to 10 cups)
- One (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 large red apple, cored and thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion
- 3 ounces soft goat cheese, crumbled

**Directions:**

1. ### Step 1
    Position one rack in the middle of the oven and another in the lower third, and preheat to 400 degrees.
2. ### Step 2
     Trim the ends off the squash, then halve it lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. (There is no need to peel it.) Slice the squash into 1/3-inch-thick half-moons. Place it on a large sheet pan, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the oil and toss to coat. Spread the squash pieces in a single layer, then roast on the middle rack for 10 minutes.            
3. ### Step 3
     Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine 2 teaspoons of the maple syrup, the curry powder, rosemary, cayenne and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Remove the squash from the oven, drizzle it with the spice mixture, toss to coat evenly, then redistribute the squash evenly on the pan. Return to the oven and roast for about 5 minutes, or until the squash is tender and beginning to brown in spots. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.            
4. ### Step 4
     While the squash roasts, arrange the pumpkin seeds on a small sheet pan and toast on the lower rack for 3 to 4 minutes, shaking the pan a couple of times, until they're fragrant and begin to pop. Transfer to a plate and let cool completely.            
5. ### Step 5
     In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil, the apple cider vinegar, mustard, the remaining 1 teaspoon of maple syrup and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and the black pepper until combined.            
6. ### Step 6
     In a large bowl, arrange the lettuce, followed by the chickpeas, apple and onion. Add the dressing and toss gently to coat.            
7. ### Step 7
     To serve, evenly divide the salad among plates. Top each with the roasted squash, pumpkin seeds and some goat cheese.
