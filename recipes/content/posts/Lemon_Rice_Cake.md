# Lemon Rice Cake

`Desserts` `Gluten Free` `Summer` `Spring` `Italian Inspired` `Easter`

Serves 8

**Ingredients:**

Unsalted butter, melted, and fine dried GF breadcrumbs, to coat a 8-to 9” springform pan 

2 1/2 cups milk 

3/4 cup Arborio rice

1/4 tsp salt

1/3 cup ground almonds 

Finely grated zest of one lemon 

4 large eggs, separated 

1/3 cup sugar

Powdered sugar, to sprinkle

**Directions:**

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Brush cake pan liberally with butter, add GF breadcrumbs and rotate the pan to coat the inside all over. Shake to discard extra crumbs.

Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy-based pot and stir in the rice and salt. Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes, stirring from time to time to ensure the rice doesn’t stick to the bottom. Then start stirring constantly, until the rice has absorbed the milk, about another 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, allow to cool slightly, then stir in the almonds and lemon zest. 

Beat the egg yolks lightly and gradually stir them into rice mixture. Stir in the sugar. Beat the egg whites in a clean bowl until they form stiff peaks, then fold them gently into the rice mixture. Pour into the prepared pan and bake 30 minutes, or until a wooden skewer comes out clean. Let stand on rack for 30 minutes, then run a sharp knife around the inside, release and remove the springform pan and slide the cake onto the rack to cool completely. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and cut into wedges to serve.
