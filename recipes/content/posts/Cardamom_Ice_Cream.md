# Cardamom Ice Cream

`Ice Creams` `Want to make`

 

  Ingredients  

  •2 cups half and half

•1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise

•8 whole green cardamom pods, lightly crushed

•3/4 cup sugar (if you like less sweet cut to 1/2 cup)

•4 egg yolks (can use 2 whole eggs instead)

•3/4 cup whipping cream (can increase to 1 cup)

•1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom (Do not add more as cardamom can give a soapy taste if too much added)

  

   Directions  

  Put the half and half, vanilla bean and crushed cardamom pods into a heavy pan and bring slowly to a boil. Remove from heat, cover, and let infuse for 20 minutes. Take out the vanilla bean and scape the seeds into the liquid. Remove the crushed green cardamom pods.

Beat the egg yolks and sugar until thick and pale. Gently reheat the milk or cream and beat a little of it into the egg yolks. Pour the egg mixture into the cream and return the pan to a low heat. Stir until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon; it will take several minutes. Do not let it boil, or you'll get pieces of scrambled egg.

Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir until it has almost cooled. Whip the whipping cream lightly and fold it into the custard. Add the 1/8 teaspoon of ground cardamom. Freeze in an ice cream maker following the manufacturer's instructions.
