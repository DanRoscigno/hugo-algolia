`Main Meal` `Want to make` `Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable` `Middle Eastern/Moroccan Inspired` `Mediterranean Inspired`

Serves 6-8

**Ingredients:**

14 to 17.5 ounces (400 to 500 grams) diced butternut squash

4 garlic cloves, peels on

1 small red onion, large dice

2 tablespoons olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Nonstick cooking spray, for the casserole dish

8 eggs

2 1/2 cups (625 milliliters) milk or cream, or a mixture of both

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

2 teaspoons smoked paprika

1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

Four 1-inch-thick slices sourdough or country bread

2 cups (about 140 grams) frozen chopped kale

2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley or sage

2 cups (200 grams) grated smoked Cheddar or Gouda

**Directions:**

1. Heat your oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Toss the butternut squash onto a large sheet pan along with the garlic cloves and onion. Drizzle with the olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss well to combine. Roast, stirring once halfway through cooking, until tender and caramelized, 25 to 30 minutes.
3. Lightly grease a 9-by-13-inch (3- to 3 1/2-liter) casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
4. In a large bowl, beat together the eggs then whisk in the milk and/or cream, mustard, smoked paprika, nutmeg, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Squeeze the roasted garlic from its skins, mash with a fork into a paste and whisk into the egg mixture.
5. Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes and scatter half into the prepared casserole dish followed by half of the kale, half the herbs and half of the roasted squash and onions. Repeat these layers with the remaining bread, kale, herbs and roasted veg, then pour over the egg mixture. Scatter the grated cheese overtop and cover with a lightly greased piece of aluminum foil. Set aside for at least 30 minutes.
6. Heat your oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the covered strata for 25 minutes then carefully remove the foil and continue to bake until puffed, golden brown and the center is set, another 25 minutes. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes before serving.

### Cookâ€™s Note:

If looking to get ahead, assemble the strata the night before. Cover with lightly greased aluminum foil as instructed and store in the fridge for up to 12 hours. To bake, place the covered strata into your cold oven and heat it to 350 degrees F. When the oven is up to temperature, bake as directed above.
