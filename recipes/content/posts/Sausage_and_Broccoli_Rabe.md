# Sausage and Broccoli Rabe

`Main Meal` `Kim Acceptable` `Quick` `Italian Inspired`

yields 4-5 servings

**Ingredients:**

- 4 cups chicken broth 
- 2 bunches broccoli rabe, trimmed 
- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 
- 1.25 lbs. Turkey Sweet Italian sausage, casings removed (I use turkey but typically one would use pork)
- 3 cloves garlic 
- 1 Tbsp red pepper flakes (or more to taste)
- salt and pepper to taste
- Parmesan cheese 

**Directions:**

- Fill a large pot with chicken broth. Bring to a boil and add penne or other pasta and cook for 10 mins. Drain the chicken broth through a colander, saving the broth, to cook the broccoli. 
- Add 1 cup water; add broccoli rabe. Return to a boil and cook until broccoli is nearly tender, about 5 minutes. Drain (or use broth to keep pasta moist).
- Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook, stirring to break into small pieces, until crumbly and browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broccoli rabe, remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook until broccoli rabe is tender, about 3 minutes more. Pour sausage/broccoli mixture on top of pasta. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.
