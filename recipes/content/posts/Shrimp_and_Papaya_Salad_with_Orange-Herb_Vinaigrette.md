`Salads` `Side dish` `Kim Acceptable` `Summer` `Spring` `Island Inspired`

Servings: 4                

**Ingredients**:   

_Salad:_

6 cups water

1/2 cup thinly sliced yellow or sweet onion

4 thin slices lemon

1/2 teaspoon salt

2 mint sprigs, about 4 inches long

1 bay leaf

1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined

2 ripe papayas, peeled and diced (about 2 cups)

2/3 cup coarsely chopped Italian parsley

1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh mint

_Vinaigrette:_

1 teaspoon finely minced garlic

1/4 cup thawed orange juice concentrate

3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

1/2 teaspoon paprika

4 tablespoons water

3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

1 tablespoon finely minced fresh mint

1 teaspoon finely minced fresh rosemary

**Directions:**

1. To prepare the salad: In a medium saucepan, combine the water, onion, lemon slices, salt, mint sprigs and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer 20 minutes.

2. Put the shrimp into the simmering liquid. Remove from the heat and set aside 5 minutes. Shrimp should be pink, curled and cooked through. Drain well, removing the mint and bay leaf. Spread the shrimp on a paper towel-lined plate for a few minutes to absorb excess moisture. Then transfer to a bowl and refrigerate.

3. To prepare the vinaigrette: In a bowl, whisk together the garlic, orange juice concentrate, lemon juice, mustard, salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika and water. Slowly add the olive oil, whisking well to emulsify. Stir in the mint and rosemary. Pour about half of the vinaigrette over the shrimp and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.

4. Cut the papayas in halves lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Cut into wedges, then cut away the peel and dice the fruit. Put into a bowl and pour half of the remaining vinaigrette over the fruit. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours. (Refrigerate the left-over vinaigrette.)

5. Just before serving, combine the shrimp, papaya and remaining dressing with the coarsely chopped parsley and mint.
