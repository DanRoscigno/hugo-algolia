# Creamy White Bean and Leek Pot Pie

`Main Meal` `Irish/English/Scottish Inspired`

8 servings or 2-4 serving meals (one can be frozen)

**Ingredients:**

_Stew:_

2 tablespoons unsalted butter (28 grams)

4 to 5 leeks, cleaned and cut into 2-centimeter (1-inch) rounds

Kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

2 teaspoons finely chopped sage

1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped thyme

Two 540-milliliter/18.25-ounce each cans white kidney beans, drained and rinsed

1/4 cup flour

4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth (1 liter)

1 1/2 cups frozen peas

3 tablespoons sour cream

Juice of 1/2 to 1 lemon

### Biscuits:

2 cups flour (170 grams), plus more for dusting

1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons baking powder (25 grams)

1 teaspoon kosher salt (4 grams)

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pats (56 grams)

1 cup grated white Cheddar cheese (120 grams)

1 1/4 cups buttermilk (300 milliliters)

Melted butter, for brushing

**Directions:**

1. For the stew: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium. Add the leeks to the pot and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the leeks start to soften and turn golden brown. Stir in the garlic, sage and thyme and cook for 1 minute.
2. Stir in the beans then sprinkle over the flour and mix well to combine. Slowly pour in the broth, turn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until thickened and the leeks are very tender. Add the frozen peas, sour cream and lemon juice to taste. Set aside to cool slightly.
3. While the stew cools, make the buttermilk biscuits: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and garlic powder in a large bowl. Add in the butter and cut or snap it into the flour until the pieces of butter are about the size of a pea. Stir in the grated cheese and make a well in the center. Pour in the buttermilk and gently mix until a shaggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and bring the dough together. Press it out into a 2-centimeter (1-inch) thick rectangle, then fold it over onto itself. Press and fold the dough two more times, then flatten again to 2 centimeters (1 inch) thick. Trim any wonky edges and cut the dough into 8 rough squares.
4. If serving immediately, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F/200 degrees C. Transfer all or a portion of the stew to a casserole dish and top with all or a portion of the biscuits. Brush the biscuits with the melted butter and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Allow the pot pie to cool slightly before serving.
