# Stout Beer Cheese Dip Recipe

`Appetizers` `Irish/English/Scottish Inspired` `Kim Acceptable`

Serves 8

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2 c. sharp white cheddar, _divided_
- 1/2 c shredded mozzarella
- 1 c. shredded Dubliner or Gruyere cheese
- 1/2 c. whole milk
- 1 8- oz. block cream cheese, _softened_
- 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard
- 2 Tbsp. freshly chopped chives, _plus more for garnish_
- 1 clove garlic, _crushed_
- 1/3 c. Guinness or other stout
- Kosher salt
- Chives to garnish

**Instructions:**

- In a medium pot, cook the garlic in olive oil on low heat, then add the milk and beer. Bring liquids to a simmer. Add the cream cheese to the pot and soften over low heat—when the cream cheese begins to melt, add in 1/4 cup cheddar, mozzarella, Dubliner, and Dijon, stirring with a whisk until smooth. To taste for salt
- Garnish with chives and serve hot.
- Serve with cut up pretzel rolls (I use Nikki P’s pretzel rolls) and broccoli, green beens or whatever else you want.
