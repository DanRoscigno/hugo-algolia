# Greek Chicken with Lemon and Feta

`Main Meal` `Kim Acceptable` `Mediterranean Inspired`

**Ingredients:**

Zest and juice of 1 lemon

 ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil

3 garlic cloves

 1 teaspoon dried oregano

 ½ teaspoon smoked paprika

¼ teaspoon coarse black pepper

 ½ teaspoon + pinch of sea salt

1 pound of thin-sliced chicken breast

¼ cup feta cheese

¼ cup fresh parsley

**Instructions:**

- First, combine the lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and all of the spices. Set aside ¼ cup of the marinade.
- Next, add the chicken to the remaining marinade. Cover with saran wrap and place in the fridge.
- Sear the chicken in a skillet.
- Finally, transfer the chicken to a serving plate and drizzle the remaining marinade over the chicken. Sprinkle the top with fresh chopped parsley and feta cheese.

**Notes:**

Marinate the chicken for at least thirty minutes to deepen the citrus flavor.

Lemon helps to tenderize the meat, making it a great option for marinades.
