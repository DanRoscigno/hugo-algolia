# Cranberry Orange Pistachio Cookies

`Want to make` `Cookies`

**Ingredients:**

- Orange Sugar:
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1 tsp freshly grated orange peel
- Cookies:
- 1 cup sugar
- ¾ cup butter, room temperature
- 1 egg
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 ½ tsp baking powder
- ¼ tsp baking soda
- ½ cup sweetened dried cranberries, chopped
- ½ cup pistachio nuts (unsalted)
- 1 TBSP freshly grated orange peel

**Instructions:**

1. Heat oven to 350F.
2. Combine all orange sugar ingredients in a small bowl; stir until well mixed. I usually rub it with my fingers to release the oil in the zest. You can leave the zest in but I usually sift it out.
3. Combine 1 cup sugar, butter and egg in a large bowl; beat at medium speed until creamy.
4. Reduce speed to low; add flour, baking powder and baking soda.
5. Beat until well mixed.
6. Add all remaining ingredients.
7. Continue beating just until mixed.
8. Shape dough into 1-inch balls; roll balls in orange sugar.
9. Place 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
10. Flatten with bottom of glass to 1 ½-inch circles.
11. Bake for 7 to 11 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.(DO NOT OVER-BAKE).
12. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets.
