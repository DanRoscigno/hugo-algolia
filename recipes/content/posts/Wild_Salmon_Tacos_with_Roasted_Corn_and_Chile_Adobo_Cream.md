-  2 to 3tablespoonscanned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce*

_For the salmon tacos:_

- 3 cups of corn kernels (cut fresh from the cob or frozen)
- 1/2 red onion diced
- 1 red or orange bell pepper diced
-  2 TBSPS olive oil divided 
-  Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 1/2 pounds wild salmon fillet
-  8 small flour tortillas

_Garnish:_

- Sliced avocado, cilantro, cucumber, crumbled cotija cheese, shredded cabbage, and cherry tomatoes(optional)

**DIRECTIONS:**

_Make the chile adobo cream:_

- You can adjust the heat on this sauce by adding a little more or a little less of the chiles and adobe.
- Whisk together the chèvre or fromage, buttermilk, and chipotles in a bowl or in the blender. Pour into a small serving dish.

_Make the salmon tacos:_

- Heat a charcoal, gas, or stove top grill for the salmon.
- Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) for the corn. Toss the corn, onion, and bell pepper in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast the corn in an ovenproof dish for 20 to 25 minutes until the corn is lightly brown and fragrant.
- While the corn is roasting, brush the salmon with the remaining olive oil and place it on the hot grill, about 5 minutes per side. Once the fish is off the grill, let it rest a few minutes, keeping it warm, wrapped in foil, until you’re ready to assemble the salmon tacos.
- Warm the tortillas briefly on the grill. Wrap in a kitchen towel to keep warm.
- Place the fish, tacos, roasted corn, and desired garnishes on the table and let everyone assemble their own salmon tacos. Pass the chile adobo cream.
