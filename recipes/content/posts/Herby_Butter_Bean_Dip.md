# Herby Butter Bean Dip

`Picnic Fare` `Appetizers` `Kim Acceptable`

### 8-10 servings

### **Ingredients:**

Two 15.5-ounce cans butter beans, drained and rinsed

1 clove garlic

Zest and juice of 1 lemon

1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

1/4 cup packed fresh basil leaves 

1/4 cup packed fresh dill 

1/4 cup packed fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for garnish

1 tablespoon tarragon wine vinegar 

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 

1/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper 

Assorted crudite and toasted bread, for dipping 

### **Directions:**

1. Add the butter beans, garlic, lemon zest and juice and 3 tablespoons of the olive oil to the carafe of a food processor. Pulse until a smooth paste is formed, about 1 minute. With the machine running, drizzle in 1/4 cup water and process until the desired texture is reached. Add the basil, dill, parsley, vinegar, salt and pepper. Process until the herbs are incorporated into the dip.
