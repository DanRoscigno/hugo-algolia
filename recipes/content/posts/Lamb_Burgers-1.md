- 1/3 cup fresh parsley leaves, coarsely chopped

###### Directions

[Watch how to make this recipe.](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/claire-robinson/grilled-lamb-and-feta-burgers-recipe.html#inline-recipe-player-channel)- In a medium bowl, combine the lamb, garlic, feta, allspice, parsley, salt and pepper, making sure not to overwork the mixture. Form the lamb mixture into 4 to 6 patties.
- Heat a [grill pan](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/grill-pan/index.html) over moderately-high heat and cook the lamb burgers until a nice crust forms, about 4 minutes. Turn the burgers over and let cook another 4 minutes. Let the burgers rest 10 minutes. Serve topped with Easy Tzatziki on a roll or bun.

###### Easy Tzatziki:

- In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, cucumber, garlic, [lemon zest](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/zest/index.html), lemon juice and dill. Season with salt and pepper. Chill.
- What Really Makes This Recipe Sing: Allspice is one of those secret weapons in [savory](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/savory/index.html) foods. You can't put your finger on it, but you know it is there. It was named by the English, because they thought it contained [cinnamon](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/cinnamon/index.html), nutmeg and cloves.
