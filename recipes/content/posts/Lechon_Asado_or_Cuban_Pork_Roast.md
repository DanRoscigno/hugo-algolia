# Lechon Asado (Cuban Pork Roast)

`Want to make` `Special Meal` `Mexican/Cuban/Latin Inspired`

### Serves 8

### Ingredients:

- 3 lbs pork shoulder
- 1 onion sliced
- 8 cloves garlic
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 1/2 cup orange juice
- 1/4 cup lime juice
- 1/2 cup lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons black pepper
- 1 1/2 teaspoons oregano dried
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon cumin

### Instructions:

- Using a sharp knife, Make a couple of slits into the pork. 
- Blend the onion and garlic in a blender or food processor. Add olive oil, orange juice, lime juice, and lemon juice to the blended mixture and mix well. Add the spices. Reserve one cup of the marinade to use for the sauce.
- Add the pork into a baking dish and pour the remaining marinade over the meat, ensuring some goes into each of the slits. Refrigerate the pork for at least 10 minutes or up to 12 hours, regularly rotating the meat. 
- Remove the meat 60 minutes before cooking to sit at room temperature.
- Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. 
- Place the meat onto a roasting pan, reserving the marinade for basting. In the pan, pour one cup of the water and cook for 3 hours, basting every 30 minutes with the marinade. If needed, cover the meat with foil to prevent over-cooking.
- When the meat reaches an internal temperature of 190F, remove it from the oven and set aside to rest.
- Place the reserved 1 cup of the sauce into a small saucepan and cook for 15 minutes until the mixture thickens.

### Notes

**TO STORE.** After cooling, transfer the leftover roasted pork to an airtight container and store it in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. 

**TO FREEZE.** Portion the cooked and cooled pork in airtight freezer-safe containers. Freeze for 1 to 2 months. Thaw the leftovers in the fridge before reheating.

**TO REHEAT.** You can reheat the leftover Cuban roast pork in the microwave or in a skillet over medium heat with a splash of the reserved marinade to prevent it from drying out.
