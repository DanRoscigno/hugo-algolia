# Cheddar Squash Galette

`Main Meal` `Want to make` `Kim Acceptable` `French Inspired`

Serves 6-8

**Ingredients:**

_Pastry:_

1 cup (140 grams) whole wheat flour

1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1 cup (227 grams) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes

1/2 cup (60 grams) grated extra old white Cheddar

1 large egg

1/4 cup (60 milliliters) milk

_Filling:_

1/2 small butternut squash (about 400 grams), peeled and seeded

2 small red onions

3 garlic cloves, skin on

2 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

1 teaspoon curry powder, optional

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoon Dijon mustard

2 tablespoon finely chopped sage or rosemary

1 cup grated extra old white Cheddar

1 large or 2 tart small apples

1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Egg wash

Flaky salt, optional

**Directions:**

1. For the pastry: Combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add in the butter and, using the tips of your finger, pinch and snap the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs and the butter pieces are no larger than a pea. Toss in the cheese.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk, then add to the flour mixture and stir just until combined and the dough will hold together when squeezed in your palm. Turn the pastry out and knead a few times to bring together. Wrap in plastic and transfer to the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.
3. Arrange your oven rack to the lowest position and heat the oven to 475 degrees F.
4. For the filling: Peel and thinly slice the squash and cut the onions into thin wedges. Transfer to a baking sheet along with the garlic cloves. Pour over the melted butter and season with the curry powder if using, salt and pepper. Roast just until tender, 15 to 20 minutes, then set aside to cool.
5. Roll the pastry out to about 1/4 inch thick and transfer to a sheet of parchment paper. Spread the Dijon over the pastry. Retrieve the roasted garlic from the cooled vegetables, remove their skins, and smash and spread the garlic over the pastry. Scatter with sage or rosemary and about 3/4 cup of the cheese.
6. Core and cut the apples into 1/4-inch wedges and add to the roasted veg along with the walnuts. Spread the apples and veg over the pastry and arrange into a slightly flattened pile. Fold the edges of the pastry up and over some of the filling to form a crust and transfer to a sheet pan. Scatter with the remaining 1/4 cup of the cheese, brush the edges of the pastry with egg wash and scatter with flaky salt, if using.
7. Bake on the bottom rack of your oven until golden and crisp, 35 to 40 minutes.
