# Macadamia Nut Tart Crust

`Desserts` `Want to make` `Gluten Free`

Makes 2-31/2 x 121/2” shells or 12-3” tart shells.

Ingredients:

10 oz. Finely chopped macadamia nuts

3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour

1/3 cup sugar

1 cup (2 sticks)  unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

1 large egg, lightly beaten 

1 tsp vanilla extract 

Grated rind of 1 lemon

Directions:

Lightly butter the tart pan(s). In a good processor, combine the chopped nuts, flour, and sugar. Add the butter and process just until combined. Add the egg and vanilla. Process until all the ingredients are well mixed.

Divide the mixture and press into the prepared pan(s). If making only one tart, freeze the extra dough, well wrapped in plastic. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake the crust for 20-25 minutes, or until the shells are golden brown. Let cool on racks before filling.
