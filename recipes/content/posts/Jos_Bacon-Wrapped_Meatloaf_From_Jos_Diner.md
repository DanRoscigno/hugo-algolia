# Jo's Bacon-Wrapped Meatloaf From Jo’s Diner

`Main Meal` `American`

### **Ingredients:**

4 cups panko breadcrumbs

12 ounces whole milk 

1 1/2 cups shredded Pecorino-Romano

1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 

1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 

1 teaspoon kosher salt 

6 large eggs, beaten 

2 pasilla chile peppers, diced 

1 1/2 bunches fresh Italian parsley, minced 

2 pounds grass-fed ground beef 

1 cup ketchup 

1/2 cup dark brown sugar 

2 teaspoons dry mustard 

3 dashes hot sauce, such as Tabasco 

9 slices extra-thick applewood-smoked bacon 

Nonstick cooking spray, for the pan

### **Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Combine panko, milk, pecorino, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, eggs, pasilla chiles and Italian parsley in a large mixing bowl and mix well. Add the ground beef and hand-mix until well blended. Set aside.
3. To make the glaze, combine ketchup, brown sugar, dry mustard and hot sauce in a small mixing bowl. Stir well using a rubber spatula. Set aside.
4. Lay bacon down slightly overlapping side-by-side in a half-sheet pan. Spray a 9-by-4-inch loaf pan that's 6 inches high with nonstick spray. Place the beef mixture in the pan and pat down to form a meatloaf. Turn pan over and tap out the meatloaf into your hand. Place the meatloaf over the center of the bacon slices. Working with one slice at a time, fold ends of each bacon slice over the top of the meatloaf. Turn loaf over and place on a rack set in a baking sheet to allow the fat to drain while baking.
5. Using the rubber spatula, spread half the glaze over the meatloaf. Bake for 1 hour, then apply remaining glaze. Continue to bake until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F, about another 20 minutes.
6. On the show, Jo made a “gravy” that he served over the meatloaf. Served with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and green beans.
