# Glazed Lemon Blueberry Muffins

`Breads`

Makes 6 jumbo muffins or 12 traditional sized muffins

**Ingredients:**

_Muffins:_

- 1/2 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 1/2 cup 2% milk
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- Dash salt
- 2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries

_glaze:_ (I don’t always use glaze)

- 1-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon butter, melted
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Directions:**

1. Preheat oven to 400°. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in milk, lemon juice and zest. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture just until moistened. Fold in blueberries.
2. Fill paper-lined regular-size muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in muffin comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
3. In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar, lemon juice, butter and vanilla; drizzle over warm muffins.
