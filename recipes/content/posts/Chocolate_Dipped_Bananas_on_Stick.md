# Chocolate Dipped Bananas on Stick

`Desserts` `Kid’s Delight`

Makes 8

### **Ingredients:**

4 large ripe, but firm bananas

1/2 cup rainbow sprinkles

1/2 cup finely chopped peanuts

1/2 cup crushed chocolate sandwich cookies

8 ounces dark chocolate chips (1 1/3 cups)

6 tablespoons coconut oil

8 ounces milk chocolate chips (1 1/3 cups)

8 ounces white chocolate chips (1 1/3 cups)

### **Directions:**

### Special equipment:

 8 popsicle sticks

1. Peel the bananas and cut each in half crosswise. Insert a popsicle stick into the cut end of each and place the bananas on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Freeze until very firm, about 3 hours.
2. Meanwhile, place the sprinkles, peanuts and crushed cookies onto three small plates, then set the toppings aside.
3. When bananas are ready, place the dark chocolate and 2 tablespoons of the coconut oil in a medium bowl and microwave for 1 minute. Stir, then microwave 30 seconds more. Stir and microwave again until the chocolate is smooth and melted, then set aside. Repeat with the milk chocolate.
4. Place the white chocolate in a heatproof glass or metal bowl that will fit over a small pot. Fill the pot with a few inches of water, making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. Heat over medium-low heat, gently stirring the chocolate as it melts. Once it’s melted, use a kitchen towel to carefully remove the bowl from the pot and set aside.
5. Dip the bananas into the melted dark chocolate and use a spatula to remove any excess. Immediately dip the banana into the topping of your choice, then place it back on the parchment-lined sheet tray. Repeat with the remaining bananas.
6. Drizzle the bananas with milk and white chocolate. Alternately, you can dip the bananas into the milk or white chocolate. Store the bananas in the freezer until you’re ready to serve them.
