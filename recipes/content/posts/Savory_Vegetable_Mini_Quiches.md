`Main Meal` `Picnic Fare` `Appetizers` `Kim Acceptable` `French Inspired`

Servings: 24      

**Ingredients:** 

1 package (15 ounces) refrigerated pie crusts (2 crusts) 

1/2 cup milk 

2 eggs 

4 slices bacon, crisply cooked, drained and chopped 

1/2 cup finely chopped zucchini 

1/2 cup finely chopped mushrooms 

1 green onion with top, sliced 

1/2 cup (2 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese 

1 garlic clove, pressed 

 Dash of ground black pepper 

 

 **Directions:** 

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Let pie crusts stand at room temperature 15 minutes. Lightly spray Deluxe Mini-Muffin Pan with vegetable oil using Kitchen Spritzer. Whisk milk and eggs in Classic Batter Bowl. 

 

2. Chop bacon, zucchini and mushrooms using Food Chopper. Add bacon, zucchini, mushrooms, green onion, cheese, garlic pressed with Garlic Press and black pepper to batter bowl; set aside. 

 

3. On lightly floured surface, roll one crust to a 12-inch circle using Baker's Roller™. Using Scalloped Bread Tube, cut out 12 pastry pieces. Press one pastry piece into each muffin cup using Mini-Tart Shaper. Repeat with remaining crust to fill remaining muffin cups. 

 

4. Using Small Scoop, fill each muffin cup with a rounded scoop of vegetable mixture. Bake 17-20 minutes or until crusts are light golden brown. Cool in pan 2 minutes; carefully remove mini quiches from pan. Serve warm.
