# Ice Cream Cones

`Desserts` `Want to make`

**Ingredients:**

- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter 
- 2 egg whites 
- 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar 
- Pinch of salt 
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

**Directions:**

- Melt the butter and allow to cool.
    **Step 1**
- Beat egg whites until soft peaks appear. Add 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar and the salt, and whip until stiff. With a wooden spoon, gently fold in remaining sugar and the vanilla. Gradually fold in flour and cooled butter until incorporated.
    **Step 2**
- Heat the iron and rub with a lightly oiled piece of paper towel, then place 1 1/2 tablespoons of batter on it and close the cover. When steam subsides, check to see if wafer is golden brown. Remove it gently with a thin spatula; then, moving quickly, roll the wafer around a paper cone. It will cool and harden almost immediately. Store in an airtight container.
    **Step 3**
