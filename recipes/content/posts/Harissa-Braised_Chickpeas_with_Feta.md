# Harissa-Braised Chickpeas with Feta

`Main Meal` `Kim Acceptable` `Quick` `Middle Eastern/Moroccan Inspired`

Makes 4-6 servings

**Ingredients:**

1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1/2 yellow onion, finely choppedÂ 

Kosher saltÂ 

1 tablespoon harissaÂ 

1/2 teaspoon **anchovy pasteÂ** 

4 cloves garlic, mincedÂ 

1/2 cup dry white wineÂ 

Two 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained and rinsedÂ 

4 fresh thyme sprigsÂ 

Freshly ground black pepperÂ 

1 lemon, halvedÂ 

Whole-milk Greek yogurt, for servingÂ 

Feta cheese, for servingÂ 

Finely chopped fresh herbs (a mix of cilantro, parsley and mint), for servingÂ 

Crusty bread, for servingÂ 

**Directions:**

1. In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook until the onion is softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the harissa, anchovy paste and garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add the wine and simmer until reduced by half. Add the chickpeas, thyme, remaining 1/2 cup olive oil, about 1/4 teaspoon pepper and a few good pinches of salt and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chickpeas are very soft, 35 to 40 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium-high heat and sear the lemon halves cut-side down until they get some nice brown marks on them.
3. When the chickpeas are ready, squeeze in the juice from the grilled lemon halves. Discard the thyme sprigs. Place a dollop of yogurt in each serving bowl, then use a slotted spoon to scatter some of the chickpeas on top. Add some crumbled feta, a handful of herbs and a bunch of turns of pepper to each bowl. Serve with crusty bread.
