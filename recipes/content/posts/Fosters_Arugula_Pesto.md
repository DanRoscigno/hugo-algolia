# Foster’s Arugula Pesto

`Condiments` `Italian Inspired`

Makes about 1½ cups pesto

**Ingredients:**

5 cups firmly packed arugula, washed, drained, and stems removed 

½ cup firmly packed parsley 

½ cup slivered almonds 

Juice of 1 lemon 

9 garlic cloves, crushed or minced 

½ cup extra-virgin olive oil 

½ cup grated Parmesan cheese 

Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

**Directions:**

Combine the arugula, parsley, almonds, lemon juice, and garlic in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Pulse several times until a paste forms, stopping several times to scrape down the sides of the bowl.

With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil and process until the mixture is smooth.

Add the Parmesan, salt, and pepper and pulse several times until well mixed. Refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to use.
