# Orange Cranberry Stovetop Scented Room Potpourri

`Room scent`

**Ingredients:**

3 sticks of cinnamon 

1 tsp whole cloves

1 Tbsp black peppercorns 

2 star anise

8 cups water

2 oranges sliced

1 apple sliced

2 lemon slices

1 cup cranberries 

3 fresh Rosemary sprigs

1 Tbsp vanilla extract

**Directions:**

Warm a dry heavy-bottomed saucepan or a Dutch oven over medium low heat. Add the cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns and star anise. Toast the spices for a couple of minutes until they become fragrant; do not let them burn. This is called blooming, and it helps the spices release their natural oils, providing more aroma. 

Add the water, orange slices, apple slices, lemon slices, cranberries, rosemary, and vanilla extract. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Let it simmer for up to 4 hours, checking on it frequently so as not to burn the pan. This potpourri will last up to 4 days, simmered a few times a day. Just add water as needed. Store in the refrigerator between uses.
