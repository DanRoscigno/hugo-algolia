# Grapefruit Pink Lady Cocktail

`Drinks`

**Ingredients:**

1/2 cup plus 1 ounce sugar

2 sprigs plus 1/4 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary

1 ounce grapefruit zest plus 2 ounces fresh grapefruit juice

2 ounces gin

Ice

2 ounces club soda

**Directions:**

1. Add 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water and the rosemary sprigs to a small saucepan and turn the heat on medium. Heat and whisk until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to slightly cool before using.
2. Combine the grapefruit zest, remaining ounce sugar and the chopped rosemary in a shallow dish. Dip the rim of a highball glass in the simple syrup, then directly into the sugar/rosemary mixture.
3. Pour the gin, grapefruit juice and 1 ounce rosemary simple syrup into a large ice-filled cocktail shaker and shake until chilled.
4. Add ice to the prepared glass, then pour the contents of the cocktail shaker into it. Top with the club soda.
