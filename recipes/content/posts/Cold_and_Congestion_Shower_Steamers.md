# Cold and Congestion Shower Steamers

`Gifts` `Room scent`

**Materials:**

—1 cup [baking soda](https://amzn.to/3k21Zlq)

—1/2 cup [citric acid](https://amzn.to/3lHwyNt)

—1/4 cup [corn starch](https://amzn.to/2GLkUCD) (optional, but helps shower steamers dissolve more slowly)

—1 teaspoon [menthol oil](https://amzn.to/3jZ7y3K), [crystals](https://amzn.to/3dmwQX2), or [vapor rub](https://amzn.to/3lJem6k) (use more to boost the fragrance)

—20 drops [eucalyptus essential oil](https://amzn.to/3nLKs2R)

—2 tablespoons coconut oil

**Instructions:**

1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and stir well.

2. The mixture should hold together when squeezed without crumbling, like wet sand. If needed, spray or drop small amounts of water into the mix until you reach the right consistency.

3. Push the mixture into [silicone molds](https://amzn.to/379jn3I), greased muffin tins, or small plastic containers.

4. Set aside to dry for 24 hours. When dry, remove from the mold (place in the refrigerator for 15 minutes if it’s warm outside and they’re too crumbly to remove), and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 2 weeks or the freezer for 2 months.

When cold season strikes, just place a shower steamer in the bottom of your shower (where the water will hit it, but you won’t step on it) and let the cooling menthol steam open your sinuses and relieve congestion.
