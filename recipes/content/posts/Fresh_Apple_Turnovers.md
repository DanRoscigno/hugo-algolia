# Fresh Apple Turnovers

`Breads` `Fall`

 

  Ingredients  

  3/4 cup of butter

1 8 oz. pkg. cream cheese, softened

1 egg seperated

2 cups flour

6-8 medium apples, peeled, cored, and sliced

3/4 cup of sugar

1 1/2 tsp cinnamon

2 tsp water

sugar to sprinkle

Combine butter, cream cheese and egg yolk; beat until smooth. Add flour, mixing well. Chill. In a medium saucepan, combine apples, sugar and cinnamon. Cook until tender, cool. On floured surface, roll out refrigerated dough. Cut into 24- 4 inch circles. Add small amount of apples to center of circle. Moisten cut edges with water, fold over filling. Press gently to seal cut edges. Crimp edges with a fork and pierce the top to relieve pressure during baking. Place turnovers on a greased cookie sheet. Blend water and egg white, brush over top of turnovers. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 375 degrees for 20-25 mins or until golden brown. Cool.

Hint: a 1 lb. empty coffee can makes a perfect cutter for the pastry circles.
