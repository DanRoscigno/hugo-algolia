# Lamb Burgers

`Main Meal` `Mediterranean Inspired`

**Ingredients:**

- 1 1/2 pounds ground lamb
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 1/2 pound feta cheese, crumbled
- 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1/3 cup fresh parsley leaves, coarsely chopped
- Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
- Tzatziki Sauce

**Directions:**

- In a medium bowl, combine the lamb, garlic, feta, allspice, parsley, salt and pepper, making sure not to overwork the mixture. Form the lamb mixture into 4 to 6 patties.
- Heat a grill pan over moderately-high heat and cook the lamb burgers until a nice crust forms, about 4 minutes. Turn the burgers over and let cook another 4 minutes. Let the burgers rest 10 minutes. Serve topped with Tzatziki sauce and a tomato slice, on a toasted  bun.
