# Poached Eggs with Roasted Tomatoes and Portabellas

`Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable`

Servings: 4Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  

**Ingredients:Â  Â  Â**   

4 (3-inch-wide) portabella mushroom caps, stems discarded

2 plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise

3 tablespoons olive oil

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar

4 large eggs

1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar

4 thin slices Fontina cheese

1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chivesÂ  Â  Â  

Â  Â  Â  Â  

**Directions:Â  Â**  

Preheat broiler. Brush mushrooms and tomatoes with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Arrange mushrooms, stemmed sides down, and tomato halves, cut sides up, on a broiler pan.

Broil vegetables about 6 inches from heat, turning over mushrooms halfway through cooking, until tender and tomatoes are slightly charred, about 7 minutes total. (Leave broiler on.)

While vegetables are broiling, fill a deep 10-inch skillet with 1 1/4 inches cold water. Add white vinegar and bring to a simmer.

Break 1 egg into a cup, then slide egg into simmering water. Repeat with remaining eggs, spacing them in skillet, and poach at a bare simmer until whites are firm but yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes.*

Gently transfer eggs with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain and season with salt and pepper.

Sprinkle stemmed sides of mushrooms with balsamic vinegar, then put 1 tomato half, cut side up, on each mushroom and top with an egg. Cover eggs with cheese slices and broil until cheese is just melted, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with chives and serve immediately.

*Cooks' note:

The eggs in this recipe are not fully cooked, which may be of concern if salmonella is a problem in your area. You can substitute pasteurized eggs (in the shell) or cook eggs until yolks are set.Â  Â  Â
