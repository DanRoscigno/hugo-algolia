# Stuffed Beef Tenderloin

`Main Meal` `Want to make` `Special Meal` `Italian Inspired`

### Makes 6-8 dinner servings

### **Ingredients:**

6 tablespoons butter

1 shallot, diced 

2/3 cup dry sherry wine 

1/4 cup dried dates, pitted and chopped 

1/4 cup dried cranberries 

1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme 

1 teaspoon minced fresh sage 

Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 

One 2- to 3-pound center-cut beef tenderloin, trimmed and butterflied (see Cook's Note)

1/3 cup Marcona almonds, crushed 

2 tablespoons minced chives 

Store-bought horseradish sauce, for serving

### **Directions:**

_Special equipment:_ butcher's twine; an instant-read thermometer.

1. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F.
2. Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter, add the shallot and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sherry, dates, cranberries, thyme and sage and simmer until just dry, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
3. Season the inside of the tenderloin* with salt and pepper. Spread an even layer of the fruit and herb mixture over it, leaving about 1/2 inch of tenderloin around the edges. Top with a layer of the almonds. Roll tightly and tie with at least 4 pieces of butcher's twine (easier to cut and portion!).
4. Place the loin on a wire-racked baking sheet and season the outside with salt and pepper. Cook until the center of the tenderloin registers 120 to 125 degrees F, about 2 hours.
5. In a large skillet, heat the remaining 4 tablespoons butter over medium heat until just foaming. Place the loin in the skillet and sear on all sides until evenly crusty and brown, about 3 minutes a side. Transfer to a cutting board and slice. Garnish with minced chives and serve with horseradish sauce.

#### *Cook’s Note

To butterfly the tenderloin: About 1 inch from the bottom of the roast, cut horizontally while opening and unfurling, just before you get to the edge. Then make a diagonal cut into the remaining thicker portion of the loin and open up to create a flat and stuff-able tenderloin.
