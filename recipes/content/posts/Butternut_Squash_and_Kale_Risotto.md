# Butternut Squash and Kale Risotto

`Main Meal` `Side dish` `Kim Acceptable` `Gluten Free` `Italian Inspired`

Serves ~ 8 side or 3-4 main dish servings

**Ingredients:**

_Butternut Squash and Kale:_

2 tablespoons butter

1 tablespoon olive oil 

1/2 butternut squash, peeled, seeded and diced

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 

1/4 teaspoon chile powder (more to taste) 

Freshly ground black pepper

1 bunch kale, leaves torn, stalks discarded 

_Risotto:_

5 to 7 cups vegetable or low-sodium chicken broth

2 tablespoons butter

1/2 onion, diced 

1 1/2 cups Arborio rice 

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

1/8 teaspoon turmeric 

1/2 cup Parmesan shavings, plus more for serving

1/4 cup heavy cream (less if desired) 

Finely minced fresh parsley, for serving 

**Directions:**

1. For the butternut squash and kale: Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter and the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the squash and sprinkle with the salt, chile powder and pepper. Cook for several minutes, turning gently with a spatula, until the squash is deep golden brown and tender (but not falling apart). Remove to a plate and set aside.
2. In the same skillet, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat and add in the kale. Toss it around with tongs and cook it for 3 to 4 minutes. Add in the cooked squash and gently toss together. Remove to a plate and set aside.
3. For the risotto: Heat the broth in a saucepan over low heat. Keep warm.
4. Add the butter to the same skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir, cooking for 1 minute.
5. Reduce the heat to low. In 1-cup increments, begin adding the broth to the skillet, stirring to combine and gently stirring as the broth is absorbed. As soon as the liquid disappears, add in another cup to cup-and-a-half of broth. Continue this process, stirring gently as the broth incorporates and the rice starts to become tender. Add salt and pepper along the way.
6. Taste the rice after about 5 cups of broth have been absorbed and see what the consistency is. Add another 1 to 2 cups of broth as needed to get the rice to the right consistency; it should be tender with just a little bit of "bite."
7. When the rice is tender, add in the cooked squash and kale plus the turmeric and stir gently. Add the Parmesan shavings and cream and stir until it's just combined. Taste and add more salt and pepper as needed.
8. Sprinkle the minced parsley over the top and serve immediately with extra Parmesan shavings!
