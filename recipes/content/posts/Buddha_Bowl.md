# Buddha Bowl

`Main Meal` `Kim Acceptable` `Asian Inspired`

Makes 4 bowls

**Ingredients:**

3 cups chicken broth (I used a fresh chicken broth that I further flavored by simmering just before using with celery, carrots, onions, lemon zest, and fresh parsley. I make chicken broth ahead and then use for various dishes when needed).

1 ½ cups quinoa 

1 large sweet potato, diced

1 large red onion, diced

¼ cup olive oil, divided

kosher salt to taste

freshly ground black pepper to taste

3 cloves garlic, minced, divided

1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root

1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (I pounded them thin)

¼ cup lime juice

2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter

1 tablespoon soy sauce

1 tablespoon honey

1 tablespoon sesame oil

2 cups baby spinach

1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced or cubed

1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

**Directions:**

Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.

**Preheat oven to 425 degrees F** (220 degrees C). Spread sweet potato and red onion onto a baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over mixture and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Bake in the preheated oven until sweet potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir 2 cloves garlic and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into 1-inch pieces.

Whisk 1 garlic clove, lime juice, peanut butter, soy sauce, and honey together in a bowl. Whisk 1 tablespoon each of olive oil and sesame oil into mixture until dressing is smooth.
