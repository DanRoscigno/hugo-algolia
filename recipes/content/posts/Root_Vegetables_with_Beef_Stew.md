# Root Vegetables with Beef Stew

`Main Meal` `American`

Servings:  8-10     

**Ingredients:**

3 Tbsp olive oil

2 lb. beef stew meat (chuck or bottom round, etc), cut in large chuncks

1 cup flour

1 medium onion, sliced

1 clove garlic, whole

1 Tbsp thyme leaf, or a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme

1 bay leaf

1 bottle of red wine

2 tsp Dijon mustard

2 Tbsp tomato paste

2 tsp oyster-flavor sauce

1 tsp honey

1/4 tsp honey

1/4 tsp black pepper

1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, or more to taste

1/2 tsp paprika

4 large carrots, cut into chunks

1 package (16 oz.) frozen pearl onions

8 small red-skinned new potatoes, cut into chunks

1 large rutabaga, wax coating removed, cut into chunks

2 small purple-topped turnips, peeled, cut into chunks

4-5 parsnips, peeled, cut into chunks

**Directions:**

Heat oil in a very large stockpot (12 quarts or larger). Dredge meat lightly in flour and, adding a few pieces at a time, brown meat thoroughly on all sides (remove the pieces as they're browned, into a bowl; when all of the meat is browned, add back the reserved meat and juices). Add sliced onion, and the garlic, and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the onion becomes translucent. Then, add the thyme, bay leaf, wine, mustard, tomato paste, oyster sauce, honey, peppers and paprika. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to lowest simmer. Cook for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add all of the vegetables and cook, covered, for another hour until all of the vegetables are tender (the potatoes will start to fall apart a bit). The sauce will thicken nicely, but if you'd like it thicker, stir in a solution of 1 Tbsp of cornstarch dissolved in 3 Tbsp water. Serve in large bowls with some crusty bread.
