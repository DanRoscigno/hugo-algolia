# Mexican Sweet Corn Cake

`Desserts` `Mexican/Cuban/Latin Inspired`

Serves ~ 6

**Ingredients:**

- ½ cup butter, softened
- ⅓ cup masa harina
- ¼ cup water
- 1 ½ cups fresh whole-kernel corn
- ⅓ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup cornmeal
- 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking powder

**Directions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Beat butter in a medium bowl until creamy. Add masa harina and water and beat until well mixed.
3. Process thawed corn in a food processor, but leave it chunky. Stir into butter mixture.
4. Mix sugar, cornmeal, cream, salt, and baking powder in a separate bowl. Add to masa harina mixture and stir to combine.
5. Pour batter into an ungreased 8x8-inch baking pan. Smooth batter and cover with aluminum foil. Place the pan into a 9x13-inch baking dish that is filled a third of the way up the side of the baking pan with water.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes.
7. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes. Use an ice cream scoop for easy removal from the pan.

**Note: Do not use frozen corn kernels**—it results in a dense, gummy texture. Made with fresh corn, the cake’s crumb is much lighter and softer. After adding the flour mixture to the corn puree, don’t whisk vigorously. Gentle mixing, just until no pockets of flour remain, will minimize gluten development, so the cake bakes up tender.
