# Chicken Noodle Soup with Tomatoes, Cumin and Cilantro

`Soups` `Kim Acceptable`

Servings: 4 main course servings        

**Ingredients:**      

2 Tbsp Olive Oil

1 Large Onion, chopped

1 1/2 to 2 pounds Chicken Pieces

1/2 tsp salt

Freshly ground pepper

1 stick cinnamon or 1/4 tsp ground (optional)

1 tsp ground cumin, or more to taste

1/4 tsp ground allspice

3 cloves garlic, chopped

2 ribs celery, sliced

1 carrot, diced

1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes with their juice

1 1/3 cups noodles (egg noodles or break vermicelli noodles into shorter lengths)

1/3 cup chopped cilantro or Italian Parsley

**Directions:**

Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion; cook, stirring, until golden**, about 7 minutes. Add chicken**; sprinkle with salt pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, 7 minutes. Add cinnamon, cumin and allspice; cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add garlic, celery, carrot and tomatoes. Add enough water to generously cover chicken; heat to a simmer. Skim foam from surface. Cover; simmer, skimming fat occasionally, until chicken is tender, 50-60 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook noodles in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender, 7 minutes. Drain well. Discard cinnamon stick from soup. Add half of the cilantro to soup. Adjust seasoning. Place a few chicken pieces in each soup bowl (or remove bones and skin and return meat to pot). Ladle soup into bowls. Add noodles to each bowl; sprinkle with remaining cilantro.

**sautéing the onion and chicken before adding the liquid gives it a deeper color and flavor.
