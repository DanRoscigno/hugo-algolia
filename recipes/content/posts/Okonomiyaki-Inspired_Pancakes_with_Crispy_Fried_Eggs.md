`Want to make` `Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable` `Asian Inspired`

Serves 2-4

**Ingredients:**

_Okonomiyaki-Inspired Pancakes:_

One 14-ounce (about 400-gram) bag coleslaw mix (about 6 cups)

1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced

1/2 cup (65 grams) flour

1/2 cup (30 grams) panko breadcrumbs

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon bouillon powder, dashi, chicken or vegetable

3 eggs

Canola oil, for frying

Toasted sesame oil, optional

### Tonkatsu Sauce:

2 tablespoons tomato paste

1 tablespoon oyster sauce

1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar

1 tablespoon soy sauce

1 tablespoon brown sugar

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

### Garnish:

2 to 4 eggs

Mayonnaise, preferably Japanese mayonnaise

Soy sauce or tonkatsu sauce, store bought or homemade

Pickled ginger

Nori, thinly sliced

Toasted sesame seeds

**Directions:**

1. Place a sheet pan in the oven and heat it to 200 degrees F.
2. In a large bowl, toss together the coleslaw mix and green onions. Stir in the flour, panko and salt and set aside. Stir the bouillon powder and 1/2 cup (125 milliliters) water together to dissolve, then add to the coleslaw mixture along with the eggs. Mix thoroughly until well combined. Set aside for 10 minutes to hydrate.
3. Heat a medium nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Drizzle in a little canola oil and toasted sesame oil, if using, then spoon approximately half of the batter into the pan, pressing down with a spatula to flatten into a pancake about 1/2 inch (1 centimeter) thick. Cook until golden and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan and place in the oven to keep warm while you cook the remaining batter as directed above.
4. For the tonkatsu sauce: Whisk together the tomato paste, oyster sauce, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar and Worcestershire in a small bowl, adding more of any one ingredient to reach your desired flavor.
5. For the garnish: Once all of the okonomiyaki-inspired pancakes are cooked, turn the heat up to medium high and add in a small splash of the canola oil. Fry the eggs until crisp around the edges, keeping the yolks runny.
6. To serve, transfer the pancakes to plates and drizzle with mayo and the tonkatsu sauce or soy sauce if using. If serving four people, cut each pancake in half. Scatter with the pickled ginger, top each with a crispy egg and sprinkle with nori and sesame seeds.
