# A Fall Salad of Corn, Cherry Tomatoes and Oven Roasted Green Onions

Makes ~ 8 servings

**INGREDIENTS:**

    - 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
    - 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
    - 1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
    - 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
    - 1 cup olive oil
    - 6 tablespoons sour cream
    - 18 green onions
    - 6 cups fresh corn kernels
    - 3 cups halved cherry tomatoes

**Directions:**

    1. Combine first 4 ingredients in processor. With machine running, gradually add 3/4 cup oil. Transfer mixture to medium bowl. Whisk in sour cream. Season dressing to taste with salt and pepper.
    2. Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Place onions on rimmed baking sheet. Brush with remaining 1/4 cup oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Cool. Cut into 1-inch pieces. Transfer to large bowl.
    3. Cook corn in large pot of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Drain; add to onions. (Dressing and onion-corn mixture can be made 1 day ahead. Cover separately; chill.) Add tomatoes and dressing to onion-corn mixture and toss. Serve warm or at room temperature.
