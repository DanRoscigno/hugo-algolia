# Coconut-Raspberry Thumbprint Cookies

`Want to make` `Cookies`

### Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 large eggs, whites separated from yolks
- 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups sweetened coconut flakes, pulsed in a blender until minced, divided
- 1/2 cup raspberry jam (not preserves)

### Instructions

- Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
- Use a whisk to combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and ground cinnamon in mixing bowl.
- Beat the egg whites until frothy, then set them aside for later. Combine the egg yolks together with the vanilla extract and beat together until smooth. Set this aside.
- In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and both of the sugars, using a hand mixer, until light and fluffy- about 7 minutes. 
- Add the egg-vanilla mixture to the butter and beat, on high, for an additional 3 minutes, scraping down the bowl often with a rubber spatula.
- Stir a **_1/2 cup_** of the coconut flakes into the flour mixture, then add the flour mix to the butter mixture in three parts, mixing on low after each addition. Scrape down the bowl after blending and just before adding the next portion of flour.
