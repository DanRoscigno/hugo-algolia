# Toasted Coconut Shortbread

`Want to make` `Cookies`

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons shredded coconut 
- 2 sticks (1 cup) salted butter, at room temperature 
- 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar 
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 
- 1/4 cup cornstarch 
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

**Directions:**

- Preheat the oven to 350Â°.
    **Step 1**
- Toast the coconut in a medium frying pan over medium heat for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent it from burning. Transfer to a bowl and place it in your fridge to cool it completely.
    **Step 2**
- In a large bowl cream the butter, sugar and vanilla until very creamy. In 3 additions, beat in the cornstarch and flour.Continue to beat the dough until it is like whipped cream in texture, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of the cooled coconut.
    **Step 3**
- Drop by heaping tablespoons on an ungreased cookie sheet.
    **Step 4**
- Bake for 15 minutes, or until the bottoms start to turn a light shade of brown but the tops and sides are still perfectly white. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle the tops with the remaining coconut.
    **Step 5**
- Let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack.
    **Step 6**

## **Make Ahead**

Cookies can be made up to three days in advance and stored carefully (they are very delicate) in an airtight container. They can be frozen for up to one month.
