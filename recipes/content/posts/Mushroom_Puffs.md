# Mushroom Puffs

`Want to make` `Appetizers` `Kim Acceptable`

MAKES about 50

##### **Ingredients:**

- **1/4Â cupÂ** unsalted butter
- **1Â** medium (or 2 small) yellow onion, finely diced
- **12Â ouncesÂ** baby bella mushrooms, finely diced (stems included!)
- **2Â tablespoonsÂ** all-purpose flour
- **1/2Â cupÂ** heavy cream
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- **1Â** 1 (17.3-oz / 490-gram) package puff pastry, thawed but still cold

**Directions:**

1. Heat the oven to 400Â°F.Â 
2. Melt the butter over medium heat, then sautÃ© the mushrooms and onions, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid evaporates, about 8 minutes.Â 
3. Generously sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the flour and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, stirring constantly, to get rid of the raw flour taste.Â 
4. Add the cream and simmer, stirring often, until thickened, 1 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let cool to room temperature (spreading on a plate and popping in the fridge or freezer speeds this up).
5. Roll each puff pastry sheet into a 10-inch square. Cut each into 2x2-inch squares (yielding about 50 totalâ€”itâ€™s okay if theyâ€™re not perfect). Fill each with 1 teaspoon of the mushroom mixture, then bring the corners together and squeeze shut to create a bundle. Place into a mini muffin pan.
6. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. (Bake for an additional 5 minutes or so if baking from frozen.)Â 
7. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.
