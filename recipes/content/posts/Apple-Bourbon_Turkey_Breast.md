# Apple-Bourbon Turkey Breast

`Main Meal` `American`

## 6-8 servings

## **Ingredients:**

_Apple-Bourbon Marinade:_ 

    - 2 cups apple cider
    - ½ cup bourbon 
    - ¼ cup firmly packed brown sugar

_Turkey Breast:_

- 1 (6-lb.) bone-in whole turkey breast (_When cooking it for just Dan and I, I use a half-breast, but use the same amounts in this recipe of marinade, veggies, gravy for the whole breast_)
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 
- 1 large oven bag 
- 2 celery ribs 
- 1 medium onion, sliced 
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted 

_Apple-Bourbon Gravy_:

    - ¼ cup butter or margarine 
    - ¼ cup all-purpose flour 
    - 2 cups reserved drippings 
    - ½ cup reserved Apple-Bourbon Marinade
    - Salt and pepper to taste

**Directions:**

_Turkey:_

- Rinse turkey breast thoroughly with cold water; pat dry, and set aside.
- Remove 1/2 cup Apple-Bourbon Marinade, and reserve for Apple-Bourbon Gravy. Pour remaining 2 cups Apple-Bourbon Marinade into a 2-gal. zip-top plastic freezer bag; add turkey breast. Seal bag, and chill at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours, turning occasionally.
- Remove turkey breast from bag, discarding marinade.
- Place flour in oven bag; shake to coat inside of bag. Place bag in a shallow roasting pan; place celery and sliced onion inside bag. Brush turkey breast with melted butter, and place on top of vegetables in bag. Close bag with nylon tie; cut 6 (1/2-inch) slits in top of bag.
- Bake at 350° for 1 hour and 45 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted into thickest portion of turkey breast registers 170°. Remove turkey breast from bag to a serving platter. Pour bag drippings through a wire-mesh strainer into a medium bowl, discarding solids in strainer and reserving drippings (about 2 cups) in bowl for Apple-Bourbon Gravy. Garnish, if desired, and serve with gravy.

_Gravy:_

-  Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; whisk in flour, and cook, whisking constantly, 1 to 2 minutes or until smooth. 
- Gradually add reserved drippings and marinade to pan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes or until thickened. 
- Add salt and pepper to taste.

**Note:** If doubling the recipe, simply place both oven bags side by side in the same roasting pan, and bake as directed.
