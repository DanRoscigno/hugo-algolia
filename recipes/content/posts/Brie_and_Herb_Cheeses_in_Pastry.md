# Brie and Herb Cheeses in Pastry

`Gifts` `Picnic Fare` `Appetizers` `Winter`

 

  Ingredients  

  1 (10"x9") sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed

1 (14 oz.) wheel Brie cheese

2 (4 oz.) pkg. garlic & herb semi-soft cheese

1 egg, beaten to blend

1 tbsp. water

Lightly flour baking sheet. Place puff pastry on prepared sheet and roll out gently to remove fold lines. Place Brie in center of pastry. Spread 1 package semi-soft cheese on Brie. Turn Brie over spread remaining semi-soft cheese on second side. Bring pastry up around sides and over cheese, wrap completely and trim excess pastry. Turn over and place seam side down. (If prepared 1 day ahead, cover and refrigerate now, but bring to room temperature before baking.) Combine egg and water, brush over top.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake until golden brown; 30 to 35 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes. Serve warm.
