- 1-3tablespoonsof milk or cream-depending on thickness of glaze wanted. For more apple fritter style like the apple fritter donut- use more milk for a thinner glaze that you can pour over the whole loaf.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

- Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Use a 9x5-inch loaf pan and spray with non-stick spray or line with foil and spray with non-stick spray to get out easily for slicing.
- Mix ⅓ cup brown sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl. Set aside.
- Combine & whisk 1 & ½ cups flour and 1 & ¾ teaspoons baking powder together in another bowl and set aside.
- In another medium-sized bowl, beat ⅔ cup granulated sugar and ½ cup softened butter together using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.
- Beat in 2 eggs, one at a time until blended in; add in 1 & ½ teaspoons vanilla extract and mix in.
- Add the flour mixture into creamed butter mixture and mix until blended.
- Mix ½ cup milk into batter and continue mixing until smooth.
- Pour half the batter into the prepared loaf pan; add half the chopped apple mixture with 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon added in and mix together.
- Sprinkle ½ of the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture you set aside earlier, on top of apple layer. 
- Repeat Layer: Pour the remaining batter over apple layer and top with remaining chopped apples cinnamon/sugar mixture, then the remaining brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on top.
- Use a knife and swirl through the mixture a few times.
- Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, approximately 60 minutes.
- To make glaze, mix ½ cup powdered sugar and 1 to 3 tablespoons milk or cream together until well mixed.  (Place mixture in microwave for 10 seconds to get it pourable if it needs a boost.)
- Let loaf rest in pan for about 15 minutes before removing from pan to let cool off completely on a cooling rack. Drizzle with glaze.
- If you want more glaze, make a double batch.
