# Gluten-free Flaky Pie Crust

`Desserts` `Gluten Free`

Makes 1-9 inch pie crust

**Ingredients:**

11/4 cups white rice flour

1 cup tapioca flour

1 tablespoon sugar 

1/2 tsp baking soda

1/2 tsp kanthan gum

1/2 tsp salt

1/2 cup vegetable shortening 

4 Tbsp cold butter

1/2 cup milk

**Directions:**

In a medium bowl, whisk together the white rice flour, tapioca flour, sugar, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the shortening and butter to the flour mixture. Using your fingertips, a pastry blender, or two dinner knives, rub or cut the shortening and butter into the dry ingredients until they are the texture of a coarse meal with pea-size pieces. Gradually stir in the milk with a fork to moisten the dry ingredients. On a board lightly floured with tapioca flour, form the dough into a ball, then a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.Â 

**Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter a 9-inch pie plate and set aside.Â** 

Roll out the dough between two pieces of waxed paper into a 12-inch round. Remove the waxed paper from the _top_ of the round and invert the pie plate on top of the dough. Place your other hand under the waxed paper and turn the round over so that the dough falls into the pan. Tuck the dough into the pan and then peel off the waxed paper. Let the overhang drape over the edge of the pie plate, while gently fitting the dough into the pan. UsingÂ scissors, trim the dough to a 1-inch overhang. Fold the overhang under evenly. Crimp the edges of the piecrust with your thumb and forefinger or press it with the tines of a fork.Â 

To make a partially baked crust: Using the tines of a fork, evenly poke holes in the bottom and sides of the crust to prevent it from rising when prebaked. Bake 8 minutes before adding the filling and finishing the baking.Â 

To make a fully baked crust: Using the tines of a fork, evenly poke holes in the bottom and sides of the crust to prevent it from rising when prebaked. Bake until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely before filling.Â
