# Preserved lemon angel food cake

`Desserts` `Summer` `Spring` `Easter`

Serves 10-12

**Ingredients:**

2 cups sugar

1 preserved lemon rind, julienned — or the zest of 2 fresh lemons (approx 2 tsp)

1 1/4 cups cake flour, sifted 3x

1 1/2 cups egg whites, at room temperature (10 to 12 eggs)

1/2 tsp kosher salt

1 1/2 tsp cream of tartar

1 tsp pure vanilla extract

 **Directions**: 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees

Combine the sugar and lemon rind (or zest) in a food processor and process until it is the texture of wet sand and all of the rind is very finely chopped, about 2 minutes.

Beat the egg whites, salt and cream of tarter in an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, on high speed until they make soft peaks.

Turn the mixer down to medium speed then add the sugar by slowly sprinkling it over the beaten egg whites. Return the mixer to high speed and whisk until the egg whites are thick and shiny. Add the vanilla, then continue to whisk an additional minute until the mixture is very thick. Remove the bowl from the mixer and add 1/3 of the flour mixture to the egg whites and carefully fold it into the batter. Gently fold in the flour in 2 more additions, ensuring everything is well incorporated.

Pour the batter into an non-greased 9″ or 10″ tube pan, smooth the top and bake for 35-45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes our clean.  Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool 10 minutes.  Turn upside down onto a cooling rack and allow to cool completely.  Once cooled, remove the cake from the pan and sprinkle with a little powdered sugar.  Serve with or without the Blueberry Gin Sauce.
