# Pressure Cooking Dry Chickpeas

`Main Meal` `Middle Eastern/Moroccan Inspired` `Mediterranean Inspired`

**Ingredients:**

- 1 pounddry chickpeas, approximately 2 cups dry chickpeas
- water
- Kosher salt
- 1 to 2 bay leaves
- 2 garlic cloves, lightly smashed

**Directions:**

Add the chickpeas and 6 cups of water to the pressure cooker. Seal the lid shut. Select High Pressure and cook for 50 minutes. Allow the pressure cooker to naturally release for 10 minutes, then vent the remaining pressure and when the release valve drops, safely open the lid. Ready to use in recipes or see storage. 

- **Seasoning chickpeas:** You can add any number of flavors to season your chickpeas. You can add a pinch of two of cumin or another spice of your choice. If you like to add a little bit of sweetness, cut up a carrot or two and add them in the pot to cook with the chickpeas. 
- **Storage:** Put the cooked chickpeas, without additional liquid, in a shallow airtight container and refrigerate for 3 to 4 days. You can also freeze them for later use. First, pat the chickpeas dry and put them in ziptop bags (it helps to spread them in a single layer and freeze them laying flat). They will last 6 months or longer in the freezer.
