# Steak with Citrus Salsa

`Main Meal` `Picnic Fare` `Asian Inspired`

## **Ingredients**

- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup chopped green onions
- 3 tablespoons lime juice
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1-1/2 pounds beef top sirloin steak (about 1 inch thick). I usually use London broil. 
- **SALSA:**
- 2 navel oranges, peeled, sectioned and chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped green onions
- 2 tablespoons orange juice
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoon chopped lemon
- 1 tablespoon chopped lime
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro
- 1 teaspoon minced jalapeno pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- 1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest
- 1/8 teaspoon salt

## **Directions**

- In a shallow dish, combine the first six ingredients; add beef. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. 
- Drain and discard marinade. Broil or grill steak, uncovered, over medium heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a thermometer should read 135°; medium, 140°; medium-well, 145°). 
- Combine salsa ingredients in a bowl. Cut steak across the grain into thin slices. Serve with salsa.
