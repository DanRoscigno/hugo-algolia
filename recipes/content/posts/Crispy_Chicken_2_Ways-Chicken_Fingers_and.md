# Crispy Chicken 2 Ways: Chicken Fingers and

Serves 2 children and 2 adults

**Ingredients:**

1 poblano pepper

7 slices stale whole wheat bread

1 garlic clove

2 tablespoons olive oil (30 milliliters)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled (about 50 grams)

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts

1/2 cup all-purpose flour (65 grams)

1/4 cup mayonnaise (60 milliliters)

2 eggs

**Directions:**

1. Using a pair of metal kitchen tongs or a fork, hold the pepper over the flame of a gas burner until well charred, turning occasionally. Alternatively, char the pepper under your broiler set to high, turning occasionally until charred. Transfer to a small bowl and cover with plastic or a plate to seal in the steam and set aside.
2. Tear the bread into small pieces and roughly chop the garlic. Add both to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse until the mixture is finely ground into breadcrumbs. Add the olive oil, season with salt and pepper and pulse to combine.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the breadcrumb mixture. Toast, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a shallow dish and spread into a thin layer to cool completely.
4. Meanwhile, peel the charred skin off of the pepper, finely dice and add it to a small bowl along with the crumbled feta. Mix well to combine and set aside.
5. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and set out two baking sheets.
6. Prepare the chicken by removing the tender from each and slicing two of the breasts into four or five long pieces that are about the same size as the tenders. Slice a pocket into the side of the two remaining chicken breasts and stuff each with the pepper and feta mixture.
7. Scatter the flour into a shallow dish. Season with salt. Beat the mayonnaise and eggs together in a separate shallow dish. Set up a breading station with the flour, egg mixture and toasted breadcrumbs. Dredge the tenders by coating in flour, dipping in the egg and finally pressing into the breadcrumbs to coat. Continue with the rest of the tenders, placing the coated pieces onto one of the baking sheets, leaving space between each. Coat the stuffed chicken breasts as you did the tenders, being careful not to let any of the stuffing fall out, and place onto the second baking sheet.
8. Place both the tenders and the stuffed chicken breasts into the oven, placing the stuffed breasts onto the lower shelf if needed for space. Bake until cooked through to 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes for the tenders and 25 to 30 minutes for the stuffed breasts. Allow the chicken to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.
