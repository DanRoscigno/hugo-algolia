1 cup frozen or fresh edamame

1 cup frozen or fresh sweet petite peas

8 oz. Snow peas

1/2 cup finely diced red onion

1/2 cup finely diced red pepper

3/4 cup olive oil

Â½ teaspoon kosher salt

Â¼ teaspoon finely ground black pepper

**Directions:Â**  

 Â  Â  Â  Â  Cook cannellini (or other type) and edamame, until just tender but with a little bite. 

Remove from water and place in ice bath; set aside. 

Blanch fresh peas for 2 minutes, do not over cook, remove from water and place in ice bath. 

Drain vegetables well before combining for salad, you don't want extra water in your bowl. You can pat dry with paper towel, this helps the vinaigrette adhere best.

Sautee onion and pepper just briefly and add to vegetables.

Vinaigrette: Mix lemon juice, vinegar, salt and pepper in small bowl. In a slow stream, pour and whisk in extra virgin olive oil to emulsify. Add finely chopped mint and corriander leaves.
