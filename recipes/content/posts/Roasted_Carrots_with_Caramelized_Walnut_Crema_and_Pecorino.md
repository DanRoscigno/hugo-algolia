# Roasted Carrots with Caramelized Walnut Crema and Pecorino

`Want to make` `Side dish` `Kim Acceptable`

Serves 4-6

**Ingredients:**

7 ounces jumbo organic carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch-thick coins

1/4 ounce kosher salt 

1/4 cup light brown sugar 

.03 ounce fresh rosemary sprigs 

.03 ounce fresh thyme sprigs 

Olive oil, for drizzling 

###### Crema:

2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil

6 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced 

8 ounces walnuts 

8 ounces really green olive oil 

Kosher salt 

1 wedge Pecorino-Romano, for shaving 

**Directions:**

1. Add the carrots to an 8-inch square baking dish in an even layer. Combine the salt, brown sugar, rosemary and thyme in a bowl until combined, then spread over the carrots. Allow these to sit in the refrigerator for 10 to 12 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
3. Remove the carrots from the sugar-salt mixture and add to a 9-inch oval enameled baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and toss to combine. Roast until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, make the crema: To a medium, high-sided saute pan over medium heat add the oil and heat until hot. Add the shallots and allow to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Add the walnuts and toss to combine. Add enough water to cover the bottom the pan, about 1 cup, and bring to a simmer. Turn off the heat and pour the mixture into a food processor. Turn on the machine and stream in the olive oil. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt as needed. Set aside until ready to serve.
5. Spoon the crema on the bottom of a large serving platter. Top with the roasted carrots and shaved pecorino.
