# Beverly’s Friday Night Fudge

`Gifts` `Gluten Free` `Kid’s Delight` `Candy` `Camping`

**Ingredients:**

2 cups sugar

5 Tbsp (level) unsweetened cocoa

1 cup whole milk

2 Tbsp butter

1 tsp. Vanilla extract

**Directions:**

Mix the sugar and cocoa in heavy bottomed pan. Add milk and stir. Place heat to medium high, stirring, until mixture comes to a full boil. Turn heat down to medium and stir frequently for 4 minutes or until sugar crystals are dissolved. Turn heat down to low simmer and stir every once in a while. As mixture thickens test it for the _ball stage._ When mixture reaches the ball stage, remove from heat and stir to cool. As it thickens some and cools some, add butter and continue to stir. As it thickens some more, add vanilla. Pour into pan greased with butter and place in refrigerator. Cut into squares and serve. 

*place cold water in a cup and pour a tablespoon of fudge into cup. If it forms a ball, it is cooked. Continue to cook if it doesn’t form a ball. Watch closely!

History: In the Joos family’s early days, this was a regular treat on Friday nights, while watching “Gomer Pyle”on TV. We took turns being the lucky one who got to lick the spoon after it was spooned into the final pan!
