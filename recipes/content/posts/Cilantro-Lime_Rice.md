# Cilantro-Lime Rice

`Side dish` `Mexican/Cuban/Latin Inspired`

Makes 3 cups of cooked rice

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup uncooked jasmine rice
- 2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg

### **Directions:**

### Step 1: Prepare the rice

Prep the rice by placing both the rice and broth in a small saucepan and bringing it to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, covered, for 12-15 minutes until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.

### Step 2: Allow it to rest

Jasmine rice is notorious for sticking to the bottom of the saucepan, so we let the rice sit for 5 to 10 minutes before stirring. It takes a bit of patience and self-control, but it’ll be [worth it when you have soft, fluffy grains](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-make-perfect-rice/)!

### Step 3: Fluff it up

It’s time to add your seasonings. Add the remaining ingredients to the rice and fluff the mixture with a fork. The lime juice and fresh cilantro are obvious, but the pinch of ground nutmeg is our second secret ingredient. This warming spice will seep into the grains, adding a slightly spicy aroma while also bringing out the rich flavor of the rice and enhancing the bright lime and herbaceous cilantro flavors. Yum!
