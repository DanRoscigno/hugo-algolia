# Spicy Orange Beef & Broccoli Stir-Fry

`Main Meal` `Asian Inspired`

Servings: 6Â  Â  Â  

**Ingredients:Â  Â**  

3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce

1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine, or dry sherry

1 tablespoon cornstarch

1/2 teaspoon sugar

3 teaspoons peanut oil, or canola oil, divided

1 pound beef sirloin, trimmed and sliced against the grain into 1/8-inch-thick slices

2 tablespoons minced garlic

2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger

6-8 small dried red chiles

2 pounds broccoli, cut into small florets (6 cups)

1/3 cup water

1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced

1/2 cup sliced scallion greens

Â  Â  Â  Â  

**Directions:**

With a small sharp knife or vegetable peeler, carefully pare wide strips of zest from one of the oranges. Cut zest into 1-inch strips and set aside. Squeeze juice from all the oranges into a small bowl (for about 3/4 cup). Add soy sauce, rice wine (or sherry), cornstarch and sugar and stir to combine; set aside.

 

Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat until almost smoking. Add beef and stir-fry just until no longer pink on the outside, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels and set aside.

Add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil to the pan and heat until very hot. Add garlic, ginger, chiles and the reserved orange zest; stir-fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broccoli and water. Cover and steam, stirring occasionally, until the water has evaporated and the broccoli sizzles, about 3 minutes. Add bell pepper and stir-fry for 1 minute more.

Stir the reserved orange sauce and pour it into the wok. Bring to a boil, stirring; cook until the sauce has thickened slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add scallion greens and the reserved beef and toss to coat with sauce; heat through.

**Tips & Notes:**

 * Freezing the beef sirloin for 30 minutes makes it easier to cut into very thin slices.
