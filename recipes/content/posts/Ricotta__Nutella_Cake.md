# Ricotta & Nutella Cake

`Desserts` `Italian Inspired`

#### **Ingredients :**

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1 cup sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder

3/4 teaspoon salt

3 large eggs

1 15 oz. container whole milk ricotta

1 teaspoon vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste

1 stick unsalted butter, melted and cooled to lukewarm

Nutella, to taste

confectioners  sugar, optional

#### **Instructions:**

1) Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.

2) Spray a 9-inch cake pan with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.

3) In a medium bowl, sift the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt and set aside.

4) In another larger bowl, combine eggs, ricotta, vanilla extract, and butter. Using a handheld whisk, blend these ingredients until combined.

5) Slowly add the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients and using a rubber spatula, mix well, just until combined.

6) Add batter into cake pan and spread evenly.

7) Microwave the Nutella for just about 20 seconds. Using two coffee spoons, drop spoonfuls of Nutella on top of the cake and spread just a bit. (You can also opt to just leave the spoonfuls as is and not spread them out.) *See tip below.

8) Bake for about 48 to 50 minutes, or until golden brown. You can test for doneness by inserting a toothpick until it comes out clean.

Remove from oven to cool before dusting with confectioners sugar, if using, then slice.

*Tip: I microwave the Nutella for just a few seconds. I do this so that the Nutella is not too heavy/solid and risk it dropping to the bottom of the pan. You can also skip this step and just mix the Nutella with a fork really well to loosen it up a bit.
