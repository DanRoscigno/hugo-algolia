Makes 2 servings

**Ingredients:**

_Candied Nuts_

1 1/2 Tbsp pure maple syrup 

1 tsp cinnamon 

1/2 tsp vanilla 

Pinch of salt

1/2 cup raw cashews

_Dressing_

2 Tbsp avocado oil

2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar 

1/2 tsp tahini

Salt and pepper

_Salad_ 

5 oz spring mix

1/2 cup blueberries

**Directions:**

Prepare the candied nuts: mix all ingredients except the cashews in a small bowl. Over medium heat, toast the cashews until they are fragrant. Once the cashews are toasted, add the syrup mixture, stirring until excess liquid has candied onto nuts. Pour onto a piece of parchment/wax paper to cool. 

Prepare the dressing: whisk all dressing ingredients together in a separate bowl until weâ€™ll combined. 

Combine spring mix, blueberries, cherries and goat cheese in a serving bowl. Top with cooled nuts. Drizzle with dressing and toss.
