# Peppered Pork Bruschetta

`Appetizers` `Snack` `Mediterranean Inspired`

Serves 4-6

**Ingredients:**

_Pork:_

12 ozs. Pork tenderloin, sliced crosswise into 12

1 small sourdough loaf (or Dans GF baguette from Coop)

5 Tbsp olive oil, plus extra for brushing

2 tomatoes, sliced

2 large dill pickles, diagonally sliced

_Marinade:_

1 tsp black peppercorns

1 tsp fennel seeds

1 tsp paprika

1/2 tsp sea salt flakes

2 garlic cloves, chopped

Grated rind of 1/2 lemon

1 Tbsp olive oil

**Directions:**

Put the sliced porkÂ  between two sheets of plastic wrap and flatten with a meat mallet, until thin.

Grind the marinade ingredients to a paste using a mortar and pestle. Rub the paste into meat and let marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before cooking. 

Slice the bread into six 1/2 inch slices, using the wider part of the loaf. Lightly toasted on both sides. Brush one side with olive oil and cut each slice in half. Set aside and keep warm. 

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add the pork and cook, in batches if necessary, for 1 minute on each side. Place a tomato slice on each piece of toast, followed by a slice of pork. Top with a dill pickle slice and serve warm or at room temperature.
