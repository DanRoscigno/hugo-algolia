# Strawberry-Rhubarb Jam

`Preserves and Jams`

Makes 3 1/2 cups

**Ingredients:**

5 cups chopped rhubarb (about ten 12-inch stalks)

3 cups quartered hulled strawberries (about 1 pound)

2 1/2 cups sugar

Zest of 1 lemon plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice

Kosher salt

**Directions:**

1. Toss the rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, lemon zest and juice and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan to combine, then mash slightly to release some of the berry juice. Set aside for 10 minutes to allow the mixture to macerate and the sugar to dissolve. Meanwhile, place a small plate in the freezer to chill; this will be used to test the doneness of the jam.
2. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat. (See Cook's Note for flavor additions.) Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium low, stirring frequently. Continue to cook until the jam becomes thick and syrupy, about 1 1/2 hours. To test doneness, place a small amount of the jam onto the chilled plate and freeze for 2 minutes. Drag your finger or spoon through the jam. If the jam holds its shape and thickness, remove from the heat. If it's runny, continue to cook and test again in 5-minute increments. Once the jam has reached the right consistency, transfer to jars and cool completely before storing, covered tightly. Jam will keep in the refrigerator for up to 6 months. 

### Cook’s Note

Try these suggested additions for depth of flavor: 1) Add 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper to the mixture before cooking. 2) Scrape the seeds and add the pod of 1 whole vanilla bean, split lengthwise, into the mixture before cooking (remove the pod before storing). Or use 2 teaspoons vanilla-bean paste. 3) Add 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar to the mixture just before removing from the heat.
