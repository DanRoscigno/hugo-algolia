# Pomegranate Vinaigrette

`Fall` `Winter` `Salad Dressings`

- ½ cup extra virgin olive oil
- ¼ cup Pomegranate juice reduction* to make your own see instructions below
- 2 teaspoons finely minced shallots
- 2 tablespoons champagne vinegar
- juice of half a lemon
- 2 teaspoons honey optional, if you are living sugar free omit
- pinch of sea salt

**Directions:**

1. Combine all ingredients in glass container. Shake! Can be kept refrigerated for one week.
2. *****To reduce pomegranate juice, simply simmer 1 cup pomegranate juice in small sauce pan until it is reduced to a ¼ cup. I measure after 15 minutes and every few minutes after that. Just be sure not to forget about it! After it is reduced to a ¼ cup, allow to cool before using.
