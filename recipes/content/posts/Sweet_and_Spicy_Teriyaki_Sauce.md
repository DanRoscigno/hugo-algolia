# Sweet and Spicy Teriyaki Sauce

`Condiments` `Island Inspired`

1/2 cup soy sauce

1 teaspoon of minced ginger-garlic paste

4 tablespoons of brown sugar(increase or reduce as per your need)

2 tablespoons of cornstarch(you need 1/4 cup extra water to mix)

1/2 teaspoon chilli flecks

Let the ingredients simmer for 10 minutes over low-medium heat.

Constantly check on the taste as you want the sweet and spicy flavours coming through, and make adjustments accordingly.

While the ingredients in the pan simmer, add slightly warm water to a small bowl, then stir in the cornstarch making sure there are no visible lumps, strain if there are any before adding it to the slow simmering sauce.

Reduce fire to low and pour in the cornstarch liquid and stir continuously, in seconds you’ll see a visible change in the sauce.

Simmer for a few minutes until you are satisfied with the thickness.

Add chilli flakes to make it spicy, start with 1 tablespoon. if you need to make a really spicy sauce add some chilli powder as well.

If the sauce coats the spoon as it drizzles to the bowl, then it is done, remove from heat and set aside to cool.
