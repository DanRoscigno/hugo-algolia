`Want to make` `Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable`

Makes 2 Sandwiches 

### Ingredients:

- [3 tablespoons olive oil](https://amzn.to/2REC7OB)
- 1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 2 heaping handfuls arugula
- 2 eggs, sunnyside up
- 2 everything bagels, toasted
- 4 slices Cheddar cheese, or cheese of choice
- 1/2 ripe apple, sliced 
- 1/2 ripe bosc pear, cored and sliced
- 4 tablespoons fig preserves

### Instructions:

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add the sliced onion and saute, stirring occasionally, until onions begin to sweat and turn translucent, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle liberally with sea salt, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden-brown and caramelized, about 45 minutes more. 
2. Preheat the oven to the high broil setting. 
3. Slice the bagels in half and place them on a baking sheet. Toast on the top shelf of the oven under the broiler until golden-brown, about 1 minute. Remove bagels from the oven and add a slice of cheddar on all four slices of bagel. Place back in the hot oven until melted, about 1 to 2 minutes. 
4. Smear 1 tablespoon of fig preserves over each cheesy bagel slice. 
5. Top the bagel bottoms with wilted arugula, sliced apple, pear, caramelized onions, and a sunny side up egg. Place the bagel tops on top, slice in half and serve.
