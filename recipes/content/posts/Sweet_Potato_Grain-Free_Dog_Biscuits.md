# Sweet Potato Grain-Free Dog Biscuits

`Dog`

#### **INGREDIENTS:**

- 1 1/2 cup coconut flour
- 1/2 cup peanut butter or nut butter of choice, no added ingredients
- 4 organic eggs
- 1/2 cup coconut oil
- 1 cup + 2 tbsp sweet potato puree

#### **DIRECTIONS:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350F.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients until they are blended completely, then form a ball.
3. Take two sheets of parchment paper and roll out a dough.
4. Take the desired cookie cutter and cut your treats. You can skip this step and simply cut the treats after they’re cooked, or better do it before baking.
5. Transfer the dough to a baking sheet and bake up to 15 minutes.
6. Set away to cool completely and serve to the dog. Yes, it’s that easy!
