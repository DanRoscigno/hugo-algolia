_Honey Syrup:_

1/2 cup orange juice

1/2 cup turbinado sugar

1/2 cup Greek honey

1/4 cup lemon juice

Pinch kosher salt

_Cake:_

- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter for greasing the pan
- 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons shelled pistachios (unsalted or lightly salted)
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 cup Greek honey
- 2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste
- 1/4 teaspoon almond extract
- Zest of 2 oranges
- 1/2 cup full-fat Greek yogurt
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

### To Serve:

Fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries). 

Lightly sweetened whipped cream or whipped Greek yogurt

**Directions:**

Special equipment:

a 9-inch springform pan

1. _For the honey syrup:_ Add the orange juice, turbinado sugar and 1/2 cup water to a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, just until the sugar dissolves, then remove the pan from the heat and add the honey, lemon juice and salt. Stir and set aside to cool.
2. _For the cake:_ **Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F** and line a 9-inch round springform pan with parchment paper. Grease the lined pan with the tablespoon of butter all over the sides and bottom.
3. In the bowl of a food processor, add the pistachios and 2 tablespoons flour. Pulse to grind to a flour consistency.
4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pistachio flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and remaining cup flour and whisk together.
5. In another large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, butter, honey, vanilla, almond extract and orange zest and whisk until smooth. Add the yogurt and lemon juice and whisk until fully combined.
6. Add half the flour mixture and combine gently. Add the second half and fold the batter with a spatula until just fully combined. Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan.
7. Bake the cake on the center rack of the oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean or with a few crumbs attached, 40 to 50 minutes.
8. Remove the cake from the oven and immediately poke it all over with a toothpick or skewer. Pour the syrup onto it. **Set the cake aside to cool for 2 hours.**
9. Remove the side of the springform pan. Transfer the cake to a serving platter and serve with fresh berries and lightly sweetened whipped cream or whipped Greek yogurt.
