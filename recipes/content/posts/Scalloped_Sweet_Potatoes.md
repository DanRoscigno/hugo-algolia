# Scalloped Sweet Potatoes

`Thanksgiving` `Side dish` `Kim Acceptable`

Makes ~ 8 servings

**Ingredients:**

- 2 ½ pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices (about 8 cups) 
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 
- 1 small onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup) 
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
- ½ teaspoon salt 
- ¼ teaspoon white or black pepper 
- 2 ½ cups low-fat milk 
- 1 cup shredded Gruyère cheese, divided 
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary

**Directions:**

- Position racks in upper and lower third of oven; preheat to 425 degrees F.
    **Step 1**
- Toss sweet potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil in a large bowl until well coated. Divide between 2 large baking sheets and spread in an even layer. Roast, rotating the pans from top to bottom about halfway through, until tender and beginning to brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
    **Step 2**
- Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook, stirring frequently, until very soft and golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Add flour, salt and pepper; cook, stirring, for 1 minute more. Add milk; cook, stirring and scraping up any brown bits at the bottom of the pan. increase heat to medium high; cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
    **Step 3**
- When the sweet potatoes are done, remove them from the oven. Preheat the broiler. Transfer half the sweet potatoes to a 2-quart broiler-safe baking dish. Spread half the sauce over the sweet potatoes and top with 1/2 cup cheese. Add the remaining sweet potatoes and top with the remaining sauce and cheese. Broil, watching carefully, until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is beginning to brown, 1 to 5 minutes, depending on your broiler. Let stand 10 minutes. Serve topped with rosemary.
    **Step 4**

**Tips:**

To make ahead: Roast potatoes (Step 2) up to 30 minutes ahead. Prepare sauce (Step 3), cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day; gently reheat until steaming before combining with the potatoes and cheese.
