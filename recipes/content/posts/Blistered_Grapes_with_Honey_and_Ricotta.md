`Want to make` `Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable`

4-6 Servings

**Ingredients:**

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 

Pinch ground cardamom 

1 teaspoon olive oil 

1 bunch red seedless grapes, removed from the stems (about 4 cups) 

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for finishing 

2 cups fresh ricotta 

1/2 cup honey 

1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted 

1/4 cup chia seeds 

**Directions:**

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom into the skillet and toast for a few seconds. Add the oil, grapes and salt to the skillet and cook, tossing every few seconds, until the grapes start to blister on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes.
2. Divide the ricotta among four bowls. Top each bowl with grapes, a drizzle of honey, almonds and chia seeds.
