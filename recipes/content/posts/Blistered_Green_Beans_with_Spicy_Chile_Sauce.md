# Blistered Green Beans with Spicy Chile Sauce

`Side dish` `Kim Acceptable`

Makes 8 servings

**Ingredients:**

_Green Beans:_

Kosher salt

2 pounds green beans, trimmed 

1/4 cup Garlic Oil, recipe follows

2 tablespoons red chile paste, such as gochujang 

1 tablespoon honey 

_Garlic Oil:_

1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

2 cloves garlic, crushed

**Directions:**

1. Preheat the oven to broil.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season generously with salt. Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl. Blanch the green beans in the boiling water until tender but still crisp, about 2 minutes. Drain and immediately shock in the ice bath. Drain the beans and pat dry well.
3. Add the Garlic Oil, chile paste, honey and salt to taste to a large bowl. Add the green beans and toss to coat. Transfer to 2 baking sheets and broil until brown and blistered in spots, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve immediately.

_Garlic Oil:_

**Yield:** 1/2 cup

1. Combine the olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan. Turn the heat to medium low and gently poach the garlic for 5 minutes; the oil should be at a very bare simmer but not boiling, otherwise the garlic will burn. Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely. Once cool, discard the garlic.
