# Cheesy Baked Eggs

`Want to make` `Breakfasts` `Kim Acceptable`

Serves 8-10

**Ingredients:**

4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature

3 cups chopped mustard greens 

1 clove garlic, minced 

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

12 large eggs, lightly beaten 

1/2 cup milk 

1/2 cup baking mix, preferably Bisquick

2 cups grated sharp yellow Cheddar

2 cups grated Monterey Jack cheese 

2 cups frozen hash browns 

**Directions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon softened butter.
2. Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the mustard greens, garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper and saute just until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.
3. Whisk together the eggs, milk, baking mix, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some pepper in a bowl until well incorporated. Stir in the mustard greens, cheeses and hash browns. Pour into the greased baking dish. Bake until puffed lightly, golden brown and soft-set in the middle, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool slightly before slicing and serving warm.
