# Edamame and Arugula Soup

`Soups` `Kim Acceptable`

 

  Ingredients  

  1 tbsp olive oil

1 ½ cups shelled edamame

1 cup packed arugula

4 cups vegetable stock

½ onion, chopped

salt  

   Directions  

  Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large pot, then add the onion. Cook, stirring often, until translucent and slightly browned.

Add the edamame and 3 cups vegetable stock. Simmer over medium-low heat until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Add the arugula and stir in briefly until wilted.

Pour the soup into a blender and purée (or use an immersion blender to purée it in the pot). Pour it back into the pot and taste for seasoning, adding salt if needed. If the soup is too thick, thin it out with the extra cup of vegetable stock until it is the desired consistency.

Serve slightly warm, at room temperature, or chilled (adding a bit more stock if needed).
