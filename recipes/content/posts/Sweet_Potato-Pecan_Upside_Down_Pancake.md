`Breakfasts`

Servings: 8Â  Â  Â  

**Ingredients:Â  Â  Â**  

1 3/4 cups sifted cake flour

6 Tbsp sugar

2 tsp baking powder

1 tsp pumpkin pie spice

1/2 tsp salt

1/4 tsp baking soda

2 egg yolks, room temperature

2 cups buttermilk

1 tsp vanilla

2 Tbsp melted butter, cooled

1/2 cup mashed baked sweet potato (about 7 ounces raw)

3 egg whites, room temperature

1/8 tsp cream of tartar

2 Tbsp (1/4 stick) butter

1 cup pecans, coarsely chopped

1/3 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar

1/2 tsp cinnamon

Syrup or pancake topping

**Directions:**

Sift four, 4 Tbsp sugar and next 4 ingredients into large bowl. Using electric mixer, beat yolks until thick and pale. Blend in buttermilk and vanilla. Mix in melted butter. Beat in sweet potato. Gradually add to dry ingredients, stirring to blend. 

Using clean dry beaters, beat whites and cream of tartar to soft peaks. Add remaining 2 Tbsp sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Gently fold 1/4 of whites into batter. Fold batter into remaining whites.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Melt butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add pecans and cook until toasted, about 3 minutes. Stir in brown sugar. Remove from heat. Mix in cinnamon. Pour batter over pecan mixture. Bake until pancake is puffed and golden brown, about 25 minutes. Unmold and drizzle with syrup.Â  Â  Â
