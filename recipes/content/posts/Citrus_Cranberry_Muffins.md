# Citrus Cranberry Muffins

`Gifts` `Breads` `Fall`

Servings: 6 jumbo or 12 regular size muffins 

**Ingredients:Â  Â  Â**  

2 cups all-purpose flour

1 cup sugar

1 1/2 tsps baking powder

1 tsp salt

1/2 tsp baking soda

Either 1/4 butter (melted) or vegetable oil

1 egg well beaten

1 tsp grated orange or lemon peel (I think orange is the best, but Dan likes lemon)

3/4 cup orange juice or lemon juice (depending on what you decide above)

1 1/2 cups chopped cranberries

(***if you choose to go the lemon route then add another 1/4 cup of sugar to help combat the tartness of the lemons).

**Directions:**

Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda into a large bowl. Mix butter/veg oil, egg, orange/lemon peel, and orange/lemon juice together. Begin to stir into dry mixture, when almost all incorporated add chopped cranberries and only mix enough to get incorporated. Fill muffin pan 2/3 full. Bake at 350 degrees for about 25-35 mins depending on pan chosen and size of muffins. Make sure they are golden brown!Â  Â  Â
