# Roasted Turkey Breast with Dried Fruits Pan Sauce

`Want to make` `Kim Acceptable` `Fall` `Winter`

Makes 6 servings

**Ingredients:**

1 skin-on boneless turkey breast, about 4 pounds

Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper 

2 cups white wine 

1/2 cup dried cranberries 

1/2 cup dried apricots, diced the same size as the cranberries 

1/4 cup canola oil 

4 cloves garlic, smashed 

2 sprigs fresh rosemary 

5 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 shallots, minced 

2 cups chicken stock 

1 teaspoon cider vinegar 

6 fresh sage leaves, minced 

Zest of 1 lemon 

Flaky sea salt, for garnish

**Directions:** 

1. Season the turkey breast on both sides with kosher salt and pepper. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 24 hours on a metal rack in a baking sheet.
2. Bring the turkey breast to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
3. In a medium saucepan, bring the white wine to a boil. Pour over the dried cranberries and apricots in a large heatsafe bowl. Allow to cool and the fruit to absorb some of the liquid, about 1 hour.
4. In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. When the pan begins to lightly smoke, season the turkey with more kosher salt and pepper. Place the turkey in the pan skin-side down. When it begins to brown, flip the turkey, add the garlic, rosemary and 3 tablespoons of the butter and baste for 1 minute. Transfer to the oven and roast until the internal temperature registers 155 degrees F, 35 to 45 minutes depending on the size of the breast. Set the turkey aside skin-side up to rest for about 1 hour.
5. Return the pan to medium-high heat, add the shallots and dried fruit with the wine and cook until the liquid is almost evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and reduce by half, 10 to 15 minutes. Finish with the vinegar, sage, lemon zest and remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Season with kosher salt and pepper.
6. Slice the turkey, arrange on a large serving dish and pour the sauce over it. Garnish with flaky sea salt.
