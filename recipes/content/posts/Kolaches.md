`Want to make` `Gifts` `Breads`

## **Ingredients:**

2 packages (1/4 ounce each) active dry yeast

1/2 cup sugar, divided

2 cups warm 2% milk (110° to 115°)

5-3/4 to 6-1/2 cups all-purpose flour

4 large egg yolks, room temperature

1 teaspoon salt

1/4 cup butter, softened

2 cups canned prune, poppy seed, cherry or lemon pie filling

1 large egg white, beaten

## **Directions:**

- In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in warm milk; let stand 10 minutes. In large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, remaining sugar, egg yolks, salt, butter and yeast/milk mixture. Mix until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to make a stiff dough. 
- Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Add additional flour, if necessary. Place dough in greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover; let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. 
- Punch dough down and allow to rise again. Roll out on floured surface to 1/2-in. thickness. Cut with large glass or 2-1/2-in. cutter. Place on greased [baking sheets](https://amzn.to/2LlenxW); let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. 
- Firmly press indentation in center and fill each roll with a heaping tablespoon of filling. Brush dough with egg white. Bake at 350° for 10-15 minutes or until rolls are light golden brown.
