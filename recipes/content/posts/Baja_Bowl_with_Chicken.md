# Baja Bowl with Chicken

`Main Meal` `Picnic Fare` `Kim Acceptable` `Mexican/Cuban/Latin Inspired`

Makes 4 bowls

### Ingredients:

_CILANTRO LIME BROWN RICE AND QUINOA:_

- 1 cup brown rice, raw
- 1/2 cup quinoa, raw
- 3 cups water
- 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 lime, zested and juiced

_CHICKEN:_

- 2 chicken breasts
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt
- Pepper

_BLACK BEAN AND CORN SALSA:_

- 1 can (15 ounces) black beans, strained and rinsed 
- 1 cup corn kernels, thawed if frozen
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 lime, juiced
- 1/4 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cumin
- Salt

_TO SERVE:_

- 1 avocado, sliced
- 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 cup salsa verde
- 1/4 cup Greek yogurt, or sour cream
- 1/4 cup cilantro, roughly chopped
- 1 lime, cut into wedges

### Instructions:

1. In a small pot or saucepan, combine the brown rice, 3 cups of water, lime zest, juice of one lime, and ground coriander. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 25 minutes.
2. After 25 minutes, add quinoa, stir to combine with the brown rice, cover, and continue to cook on low-medium heat for 15 minutes or until cooked and can be fluffed with a fork.
3. While the grain mixture is cooking, prepare the chicken. Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and season them generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
4. In a grill pan or cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat, warm the olive oil, then add the seasoned chicken and cook for 5-6 minutes per side until cooked through or they reach an internal temperature of 165°F. Once cooked, remove them from the pan and set aside for at least 5 minutes before slicing them into thin strips or cubes.
5. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the black bean and corn salsa. In a medium bowl, add the olive oil, lime juice, garlic powder, paprika, ground cumin, and a pinch of salt and whisk until well combined. Add the strained and rinsed black beans and corn and toss until well coated in the dressing. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.
6. Once the grain mixture and chicken are ready, assemble the bowls. Split the cooked quinoa and rice mixture evenly across four bowls, then top with grilled chicken, black bean and corn salsa, tomatoes, avocado, a dollop of Greek yogurt, a drizzle of salsa verde, a sprinkle of chopped cilantro, and a wedge of lime.
7. These bowls can be served immediately or stored in the fridge for up to 4 days. If making them ahead of time, it is best to wait and add the avocado, Greek yogurt, and salsa verde when you are ready to serve.

### Notes:

Although the recipe does not call for it, as it’s not part of the original Panera version, a sprinkle of Cotija cheese or feta cheese on top would be a delicious addition!
