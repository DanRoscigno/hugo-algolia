# Pumpkin Apple Dog Biscuits

`Dog`

#### **INGREDIENTS:**

- 4 – 4.5 cups oatmeal plus additional
- 1 medium apple
- 1 egg
- 1 CUP canned pumpkin

#### **DIRECTIONS:**

1. Preheat your oven to 400 F (200 C).
2. Put the oatmeal in a food processor or blender and grind it. Make sure it’s grinded evenly.
3. Remove all of the seeds from your apple. They are poisonous to the dog! Grate apple and mix it with the oatmeal in a large mixing bowl.
4. Add the egg and the canned pumpkin to the mix and mix well, until all the ingredients are completely blended. You should get a thick and a little sticky mixture.
5. Dust your surface with oatmeal and roll the dough. It should get up ½” thick. Take a dog cookie cutter and make a little bone treats.
6. Transfer them to a lined baking sheet.
7. Bake in oven for approximately 15 minutes, or until you get golden and crispy bones. Be sure not to overdo, you wouldn’t like to eat burned cookies, and so is the dog.
8. Put them aside to cool completely and serve to the dog. The leftovers may be stored in the airtight container for up to a week.
