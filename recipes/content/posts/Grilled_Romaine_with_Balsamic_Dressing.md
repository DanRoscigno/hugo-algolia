# Grilled Romaine with Balsamic Dressing

`Salads` `Side dish` `Kim Acceptable` `Italian Inspired`

Serves 4

**Ingredients:**

_Balsamic Dressing:_

1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 

3 tablespoons crumbled Gorgonzola

6 leaves fresh basil, chopped

1 clove garlic, chopped 

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 

_Grilled Romaine:_

2 romaine hearts, halved lengthwise

Canola oil, for brushing 

1/4 cup crumbled Gorgonzola, for garnish

4 leaves fresh basil, torn, for garnish

**Directions:**

1. For the balsamic dressing: In a blender, combine the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Gorgonzola, basil, garlic, a pinch each of salt and pepper and 2 tablespoons water. Blend until the dressing is creamy and the garlic and basil are finely chopped.
2. For the grilled romaine: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium heat.
3. Lightly brush the cut sides of the romaine with the canola oil. Place the romaine on the grill cut-side down and cook until grill marks form and the leaves are slightly charred, 1 to 3 minutes. Arrange on a platter cut-side up.
4. Drizzle the romaine with the dressing. Sprinkle with the Gorgonzola and torn basil and serve.
