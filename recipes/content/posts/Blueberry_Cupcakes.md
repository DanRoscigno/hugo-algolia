# Blueberry Cupcakes

`Desserts` `Kid’s Delight`

### INGREDIENTS

Sift together:

1 1/4 cups (163g) all-purpose flour

1 1/4 tsp baking powder

1/4 tsp salt

Cream together:

6 tbsp (84g) unsalted butter, room temperature

3/4 cup (155g) sugar

2 tbsp (30ml) vegetable oil

1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

2 large eggs

1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp (150ml) milk

### INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C) and prepare a cupcake pan with cupcake liners.

Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium sized bowl and set aside. Take about 1/4 cup of this flour mixture and coat 1 pint of blueberries completely (this helps the blueberries stay suspended in the batter so they do not all sink).

Add the butter, sugar, oil and vanilla extract to a large mixer bowl and beat together until light in color and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes. Do not skimp on the creaming time.

Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until mostly combined after each. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to be sure all ingredients are well incorporated.

Add half of the dry ingredients to the batter and mix until mostly combined.

Slowly add the milk and mix until well combined. The batter will look curdled, but that’s ok.

Add the remaining dry ingredients and the blueberries/flour mixture. Mix until well combined and smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to be sure all ingredients are well incorporated, but do not over mix the batter.

Fill the cupcake liners about 3/4 full with the batter (use a scoop or pastry bag). Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove cupcakes from the oven and place on a cooling rack. These cupcakes do not need to be frosted! The blueberries are just enough.
